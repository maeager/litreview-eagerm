* Introduction  
  
The development of \BNN models is a major objective of computational
neuroscience.  Recent advances in the field have made this goal more achievable
than it has ever been before.  The auditory system is characterised by the high
fidelity of acoustic information. Consequently, modelling of neural processing
in the auditory system should be conducted on a fine-grained scale to enhance
the representation of the stimulus spectrum and temporal periodicities.  Given
this complexity, \BNNs are a promising avenue by which we can expand our
understanding of neural processing of sound.

In the \CN, the first processing stage in the auditory brainstem, histological
and pharmacological labelling techniques have produced a flood of information
about the anatomy, physiology, immunohistochemistry, pharmacology and intrinsic
membrane properties of the different cell types.  There is scope for more
extensive exploitation of this experimental data in the design and optimisation
of computational models.  Success in this endeavour will enable us to improve
the accuracy and value of \BNNs for use in the investigation of brain networks.

This thesis presents a novel \BNN model of the stellate cell microcircuit in the
cochlear nucleus (hereafter, the ‘CNSM model’). This microcircuit provides a robust
spectral representation of sound and plays an essential part in speech
communication. The model was optimised using rigorous sequential methods and
simultaneous genetic algorithms. The analyses of the results demonstrate the
utility of this approach for improving \BNN models to help us better
understand complex neural processing.

\glsunset{CNSM}

This chapter critically reviews the major bodies of literature relevant to the
design and optimisation of the \CNSM model, and provides an overview of the
thesis.  The next section presents the auditory system, the \CN, existing
computational models of the \CN and optimisation methods in neural
modelling. This evidence is drawn upon in the development, analysis and
verification of the \CNSM model in the remainder of the thesis.

# implant and hearing aids.


* Literature Review

** Auditory System 

Speech is a unique and fundamental tool in communication between humans.  We
continually deal with various distortions of the acoustic environment (for
example, background noise and reverberation) as we extract information from
signals entering the ear.  Vowels are a salient feature of speech that is
spectrally and temporally distinct from other natural sounds.  The spectrum of
each vowel is distinguished by the location of high-energy spectral peaks, known
as formants. Robust representation of spectra at different intensities is
important for speech and other auditory communication \citep{YoungOertel:2004}.
The main tasks of the auditory system are to (1) separate out individual
frequency components of sound; (2) enhance spectral and temporal contrasts to
improve meaningful \SNR; and (3) extract behavioural frequency cues
\citep{Evans:1992}.



Advanced auditory fidelity and localisation are exceptional features of hearing
perception in animals.  These specialities work to a high degree despite the
input at the round window of the cochlea being one dimensional and very noisy.
Rough frequency decomposition is performed by the basilar membrane and organ of
Corti in the mammalian cochlea, which transforms mechanical signals to neural
signals in \ANFs.  The next stage of the auditory process occurs in the \CN, the
first processing stage of the central auditory pathway in which all \ANFs
end. Enhancing spectral and temporal contrasts requires sophisticated parallel
processing strategies involving networks of neurons with feed-forward and
feed-back connections.


The auditory system is topographically ordered from the basilar membrane to the
cortex in terms of frequency selectivity, also known as tonotopicity
\citep{YoungOertel:2004}.  The population of \ANFs (Figure \ref{fig:CNCatHuman})
bifurcate after entering the \CN to innervate the \VCN and \DCN, retaining their
tonotopic order \citep{Lorente:1981,Liberman:1982,Liberman:1993}.  The different
cell types of the \CN, each with unique cell properties and synapto-physiology,
produce six major outputs from the \CN\space \citep{CantBenson:2003}. Binaural pathways
converge in the \IC before projecting to the medial geniculate nucleus in the
thalamus and then to the auditory cortex.

** Auditory Nerve Fibres

# \todo[inline]{Small and concise lit review of ANFs}

# \todo[inline]{1 para on Spontaneous discharge rate (SR). More work on references here} 

Type 1 \ANFs are categorised into \HSR and \LSR fibres \citep{Liberman:1978}.
The acoustic physiology of \ANFs forms a bi-modal distribution where 30--40\% of
the fibres have \SR less than 2 spikes/s and 60--70\% have \SR above 30 spikes/s
\citep{RyugoParks:2003}. Threshold is correlated to the amount of spontaneous
spike activity that occurs in the absence of experimenter-controlled
stimulation. \LSR fibres have relatively high thresholds, whereas \HSR fibres
have low thresholds. Fibres of similar \CF can vary in \SR from near 0 to 100
spikes/s.  The bi-modal \SR distribution is present across the entire audible
frequency range for the animal, and implies a general organisational principle
for the mammalian \AN. Fibres of the different \SR groupings exhibit distinct
physiological features, especially in terms of their contribution to the dynamic
range of hearing and representation of speech sounds
\citep{RyugoParks:2003}. The collective evidence suggests that different \SR
groupings of \ANFs play distinct roles in acoustic information processing. It
might be that the \HSR fibres with their low thresholds prefer to function in
quiet, whereas \LSR fibres with their high thresholds operate better in loud and
noisy environments.

The morphology of \LSR and \HSR fibres is essentially similar. Characterised as
bipolar neurons, their cell bodies lie in the retinal ganglion region
(Rosenthal's canal) of the cochlea and their peripheral process contacts one
inner hair cell.  The axonal process is part of the \AN and enters the central
nervous barrier at the \CN root. It then bifurcates into an ascending branch and
a descending branch. The ascending branch has a relatively straight trajectory
into the \AVCN and terminates as a large, axosomatic ending called the endbulb
of Held.  The descending branch passes through the \PVCN and octopus cell region
before entering the \DCN\@.
# Along the
# way, these main branches give rise to short collaterals. The
# collaterals ramify further and exhibit en passant swellings
# and terminal boutons. 
Fibres of similar \CFs disperse to form a 3-dimensional sheet running through
 the nucleus, and stacks of these sheets represent the isofrequency contours of
 the nucleus (Figure \ref{fig:CNschematic}).
# The sheets have a
# horizontal orientation within the ventral cochlear nucleus
# but twist caudally to form parasagittal sheets in the DCN.
These projections underlie the tonotopic organisation of the resident neurons of
the \CN\space \citep{RyugoParks:2003}. \LSR fibres also project to the \GCD\space
\citep{RyugoParks:2003,RyugoHaenggeliEtAl:2003} along with the smaller,
unmyelinated type 2 \ANFs, which suggests they play a different role in sound
processing to \HSR fibres.

# 5. Structure-function correlates
# 5.1. SR and peripheral correlates
# Morphologic specialisations have been found in the in-
# nervation pattern of inner hair cells with respect to SR fibre
# groupings. High-SR fibres (>18 spikes/s) have thick periph-
# eral processes that tend to contact the “pillar” side of the
# inner hair cell, whereas low-SR fibres (<18 spikes/s) have
# thin peripheral processes that tend to contact the modiolar
# side of the hair cell [98,111]. Furthermore, there is SR
# segregation within the spiral ganglion. Low-SR neurons
# tend to be distributed on the side of the scala vestibuli,
# whereas high-SR fibres can be found throughout the gan-
# glion [82,100]. These peripheral differences are maintained
# by the pattern of central projections, and embedded within
# the tonotopic organisation.
# 5.2. SR and central correlates
# There are morphologic correlates that correspond to
# groupings of fibres with respect to SR. Compared to fibres
# of high SR (>18 spikes/s), fibres of low SR (<18 spikes/s)
# exhibit different innervation characteristics with the IHCs
# [99,111], give rise to greater collateral branching in the
# AVCN [51], emit collaterals that preferentially innervate
# the small cell cap [100,177], and manifest striking special-
# izations in the large axosomatic endings, the endbulbs of
# Held [185] and their synapses [178].
# The typical high-SR fibre traverses the nucleus and gives
# rise to short collaterals that branch a few times before
# terminating (Fig. 10A). There was a suggestion that projec-
# tions of the different SR groups might be segregated along
# a medial-lateral axis within the core of the AVCN [94] but
# single-unit labelling studies do not unambiguously support or
# refute this proposal [51,82,100,208]. There are usually one
# or two terminal endbulbs at the anterior tip of the ascending
# branch, and the remaining terminals appear as en passant
# swellings or terminal boutons. It is presumed that these
# swellings are sites of synaptic interactions with other neu-
# ronal elements in the cochlear nucleus. Approximately 95#
# of all terminal endings were small and round, definable as
# “bouton-like” [163]. The remaining endings were modified
# endbulbs that tended to contact the somata of globular bushy
# cells and large endbulbs of Held that contacted the somata
# of spherical bushy cells. In contrast to birds, low-frequency
# myelinated auditory nerve fibres in mammals give rise
# to endbulbs. Furthermore, the endbulbs of low-frequency
# fibres tend to be the largest of the entire population of
# fibres.

# There is a clear SR-related difference in axonal branch-
# ing and the number of endings. Low-SR fibres give rise to
# greater collateral branching in the AVCN compared to that
# of high-SR fibres [51,100,101,208]. In cats, the ascending
# branch of low-SR fibres give rise to longer collaterals, twice
# as many branches (there are approximately 50 branches per
# low-SR fibre compared to 25 per high-SR fibre), and twice as
# many bouton endings (Fig. 10B). These endings, while more
# numerous, are also smaller compared to those of high-SR
# fibres [163]. The greater total collateral length is illustrated
# by low-SR fibres that have an average of 5 mm of collaterals
# per ascending branch compared to 2.8 mm of collaterals per
# high-SR fibre [51]. The inference from these observations is
# that low-SR fibres contact more neurons distributed over a
# wider region of the cochlear nucleus than do high-SR fibres.
# If the perception of loudness is proportional to the num-
# ber of active neurons [195], then this branching differential
# may provide the substrate. The activation of high-threshold,
# low-SR fibres by loud sounds would not only increase the
# pool of active auditory nerve fibres but also produce a spread
# of activity throughout the AVCN. This recruitment would
# be useful because the discharge rate of high-SR fibres is al-
# ready saturated at moderate sound levels.
# There is no systematic difference in the average number
# of terminals generated by the descending branch with re-
# spect to fibre SR. Low-SR fibres do, however, have a wider
# distribution across the frequency axis in the DCN as com-
# pared to high-SR fibres [171]. The endings lie within the
# deep layers of the DCN, below the pyramidal cell layer, and
# terminate primarily within the neuropil. The average termi-
# nal field width for low-SR fibres is 230.5 ± 73 ␮m, whereas
# that for high-SR fibres is 87.2 ± 41 ␮m. The significance of
# terminal arborization differences between high- and low-SR
# fibres might be involved in details of isofrequency laminae.
# The relatively short and narrow arborization of high-SR,
# low-threshold fibres could occupy the center of the lamina
# and endow those neurons with lower thresholds and sharper
# tuning. In contrast, the longer and broader terminal field of
# low-SR fibres could preferentially innervate the “edges” of
# the lamina. This kind of organisation might establish a func-
# tional segregation of units having distinct physiological fea-
# tures within an isofrequency lamina, as has been proposed in

** Cochlear Nucleus 

There is a rich tradition of experimental investigation of the \CN, dating back
more than eighty years \citep[see,~for~example,~]{Lorente:1933}.  The synaptic
organisation of cells in the \CN has been examined in detail in various species
including cats \citep{Cant:1981,TolbertMorest:1982,SaintMorestEtAl:1989}; mice
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1988,WickesbergOertel:1990,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991};
guinea pigs \citep{JuizHelfertEtAl:1996a,OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}; and rats
\citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003,RubioJuiz:2004}.  Physiological studies
combined with labelling have given greater certainty to correlations between
physiological response types and morphological cell types
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.
Intracellular recordings have ascertained the electrical properties and
different synaptic inputs of \TS, \DS and \TV cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}.  Descriptions of current
dynamics for synaptic receptors \citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999,HartyManis:1998}
and membrane channels \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a} specific to
the \VCN have enabled accurate mathematical models to be developed at the cell and
synaptic level.
# With this information a realistic biological model of the
# stellate network is attainable and can provide further insight into processing
# of acoustic information.

The \CN receives the primary ascending input from \ANFs and contains a
heterogeneous population of cell types.  Cell types have been classified using
criteria including morphology, immunohistochemistry, synaptic organisation,
response to acoustic stimuli and frequency tuning
\citep{RyugoParks:2003,CantBenson:2003,YoungOertel:2004}.  The two major
divisions are the \VCN and \DCN\@.  The different projections out of the nucleus
reflect the highly specialised parallel processing that is performed to extract
particular acoustic information contained in the \AN.  The \DCN in mammals
generally has a cerebellar-like laminar structure with many interneurons,
whereas the \VCN consists of a magnocellular core and a marginal shell
(otherwise called the \GCD in rodents).  The marginal shell is thought to be
involved in regulating the gain in the magnocellular core from inputs outside
the \CN\space \citep{EvansZhao:1993,GhoshalKim:1997}.

Recent reviews of characterised cells in the \CN have examined the association
between the projection characteristics and the corresponding physiological
acoustic characteristics
\citep{CantBenson:2003,RyugoParks:2003,SmithMassieEtAl:2005,YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.
\citet{DoucetRyugo:2006} showed that a limited number of \VCN multipolar neuron
studies have performed physiological unit assessments as well as classification
of morphology via labelling. The \PSTH response to short tone bursts has been
used to classify \CN neurons into primary-like, chopper, or onset chopper
\citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1963,SmithJorisEtAl:1993,ShofnerYoung:1985,YoungRobertEtAl:1988,BlackburnSachs:1989}.


The afferent and intrinsic synaptic connectivity in the \CN have also been the
subject of intense interest in the literature
\citep{YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}. The network in Figure
\ref{fig:CNschematic} shows the connections within the \CN that are involved in
modulating \TS cells. The \TS cells and their synaptic interactions are the
focus of the \CNSM model and are discussed in detail in the next section.

** T Stellate Cells

This section provides an overview of \TS cells, including their cell morphology,
immuno-histochemistry, intrinsic membrane properties, synaptic contacts and
physiological properties. The respective contribution of these elements to the
heterogeneous acoustic behaviour of different \TS cell subtypes is still to be
authoritatively determined.

\Gls{TS} cells are located in the core region of the \VCN, primarily in the
\PVCN with some in the posterior part of the \AVCN\space 
\citep{Osen:1969,Lorente:1981,BrawerMorestEtAl:1974,OertelWuEtAl:1990,DoucetRyugo:2006,DoucetRyugo:1997}.
\TS cells encode complex features of the stimulus that are important for the
recognition of natural sounds and are a major source of excitatory input to the
\IC\space \citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  \Gls{TS} cells of the \VCN encode a robust
representation of the stimulus spectrum in their average rate and a temporal
representation essential for speech \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}. They
project directly to the \IC, and are therefore important in conveying
information to higher auditory centres. \TS cells are known to form a local
microcircuit network with neurons within their isofrequency lamina and across
the frequency range of the nucleus. The microcircuit includes \DS cells, a
wide-band inhibitory cell in the \VCN, \TV cells, a narrow-band inhibitory cell
in the \DCN, and Golgi cells, a GABAergic neuron in the outer granule shell of
the \CN \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}. Inhibition is
known to play a key role in shaping the average rate response, synchronisation
to modulation and onset delay of cells in the \CN\space 
\citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,EvansZhao:1998,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.

\TS cells are integrators in their intrinsic behaviour, which allows phasic
input from \ANFs to be converted to a tonic or chopping output.  The tonic
behaviour suits encoding of spectrum across populations since encoding the peaks
and valleys is relatively independent of time after onset of sound. It also
suits encoding of envelopes of sounds, which is important for speech
\citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}. The presence of active membrane channels at rest
means that \TS cells are sensitive to neuromodulatory currents
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,FujinoOertel:2001,RothmanManis:2003} and
increases their response time to temporally important features like vowel
transitions and glottal pulses
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004,ClareyPaoliniEtAl:2004}.  The average discharge
rate of the two chopper populations provides either a low-contrast
representation independent of level (\ChS) or a high-contrast representation of
stimulus spectrum (\ChT) \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003}. The temporal
coding of cells in the \CN has also been studied extensively with \AM tones
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,RhodeGreenberg:1994}, and
ripple noise \citep{WinterPalmerEtAl:1993}.  \citet{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}
went further, showing that chopper cells provide a periodicity-tagged spectral
representation that can be used to separate simultaneously presented vowels.




# distinction between \TS and \DS cells is made by their axonal projections,
# dendritic projections, and their immunohistochemistry.




**** Morphology of T Stellate Cells

The practice of classifying and naming distinct cell types in the \CN began in
the first half of the twentieth century \citep{Lorente:1933}. Star-like cell
bodies observed with Golgi impregnation were called \textit{stellate} cells
\citep{Osen:1969}. Nissl staining showed the multiple dendritic morphology of
\TS and \DS cells, hence the name \textit{multipolar} was adopted
\citep{BrawerMorestEtAl:1974,Lorente:1981}. Multipolar cells were also divided
into two groups, disperse or clumped Nissl, according to their cytoplasmic
appearance in thionin-stained sections \citep{Liberman:1991,Liberman:1993}.
Further nomenclature based on dendritic differences involving distinguishing
between planar (\TS cells) and radial (\DS cells) has also been suggested in
rats \citep{DoucetRyugo:1997,DoucetRyugo:2006}.

Distinctions based on somatic innervation in multipolar neurons separated them
into two types: type I (few somatic) and type II (many somatic and dendritic)
\citep{Cant:1981}.  \DS cells' axons project dorsally toward the \DCN via the
dorsal acoustic stria (hence D in D stellate), while \TS cells leave the \CN
ventrally through the ventral acoustic stria or trapezoid body (hence T)
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990}. Some \DS cells are also commissural, exiting the \CN
via the dorsal acoustic stria and crossing the midline to terminate in the
contralateral \CN
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,NeedhamPaolini:2007,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}.
# distinction between \TS and \DS cells is made by their axonal projections,

For consistency, the \TS cell modelled in this thesis represents each of the
various names given to neurons with similar characteristics (T stellate, type I
multipolar, planar, and chopper \PSTH units) in different animals, with closest
association with rodents and cats. The \DS cell type includes all those
previously named as \DS, type II multipolar, radial, and units classified as
\OnC\space \PSTH units.

**** Intrinsic Mechanisms of T Stellate Cells

The intrinsic cell-based properties of \VCN neurons have typically been
investigated using /in vitro/ current clamp experiments
\citep{Oertel:1983,OertelWuEtAl:1988,ManisMarx:1991,WuOertel:1984}.  \TS cells
are classified as type I due to the regularly spaced firing of action potentials
to steady depolarising current, and can be classified as simple integrators.
They have a linear current-voltage response
\citep{Oertel:1983,OertelWuEtAl:1988,ManisMarx:1991,RhodeOertelEtAl:1983,SmithRhode:1989,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}.
The response to strong negative current in \TS and \DS cells is
double-exponential, which shows the presence of hyperpolarisation-activated
mixed cation current \Ih
\citep{FujinoOertel:2001,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}.
\Ih is higher in \TS and activated more at lower potentials than in bushy and
octopus cells, so that it is less active at rest and produces a higher membrane
resistance.  This high resistance induces greater voltage changes in small
modulating current, which enhances \Ih, making \TS more sensitive to
neuromodulatory currents \citep{FujinoOertel:2001,RodriguesOertel:2006}

The \TS cell \AP has a single exponential undershoot that shows the absence of
\IKLT, which is strongly present in bushy cells, and to a moderate degree in \DS
cells threshold potassium current in bushy cells is responsible for their phasic
response (i.e. \PSTH classified primary-like units) and in \DS cells enhances
\citep{FengKuwadaEtAl:1994,ManisMarx:1991,WuOertel:1984,RothmanManis:2003}.  Low
coincidence detection at onset \citep{ManisMarx:1991,RothmanManis:2003b}.

In recent experiments with mice, a fast transient-deactivating potassium current
(\IKA) has been found only in \TS cells
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}.  \Ih and \IKA
are active at rest and play a role in modulating the rate of repetitive firing
of \TS cells \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The effect of inhibition on \TS cells
could be to reset \IKA \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}, thus priming cells for
oncoming activation \citep{KanoldManis:2001,KanoldManis:2005}.  This has been
shown to enhance place-coding across \TS cells by enhancing the first-responder
activation \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.

**** Acoustic Responses of T Stellate Cells

\TS cells receive a narrow frequency band of \ANF inputs and have a chopping
response to \CF tone bursts \citep{SmithRhode:1989,BlackburnSachs:1989}.  Few
synaptic terminals contact on their soma; the majority of inputs contact the
output to the \IC \citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.  proximal dendrites
\citep{Cant:1981}. \TS cells are the primary excitatory The response to acoustic
stimulation is measured from a \PSTH to short tone bursts
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989}. The level of tuning and suppression
of neurons receptive field is examined using the \EIRA method
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,SpirouYoung:1991,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungNelkenEtAl:1993,ArleKim:1991a}.

The regular-firing chopping pattern shown in Figure \ref{fig:chopping} is
characteristic of \TS cells. \ChS and \ChT are differentiated by the regularity
of discharge throughout the stimulus using the \CV statistic
\citep{YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  Recurrent excitation among \TS cells of similar
\CFs was first suggested by \citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The small
numbers of axonal collaterals are confined to the same frequency band as their
dendrites, indicating recurrent connections are between cells encoding a similar
frequency \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  This could
compensate for rapid transient adaptation in \AN excitation, allowing
a robust representation of the spectral energy falling within the cell's
response area to be transmitted to higher centres.

# The type I multipolar cells are narrowly tuned and respond to tone bursts with
# regular trains of action potentials, a response referred to as a
# "chopper" pattern (e.g.,
# [168,220]). Neurons that exhibit chopper responses can differ substantially in
# their dendritic morphology ([58,179,194],cf. [30]) which suggests that a further
# subdivision of this class of neurons may be possible. In mouse, the equivalent
# cells (T-stellate cells) appear to integrate input from the auditory nerve with
# that from other multipolar cells of both types

# [61]. In general, the response properties of chopper units suggest that they
# play an important role in encoding complex acoustic stimuli, perhaps including
# speech sounds (e.g., [26,131,180]).

# The projection pattern of type I multipolar cells is illustrated in Fig.
# 2F. The axons leave the cochlear nucleus via the trapezoid body
# [55,151,220,245], where they make up the ventral thin fibre component
# [31,215,245,248]. Possibly because they are thinner than the axons of the other
# cell types, there have been few reports of successful intra-axonal injections of
# these fibres so it is not entirely clear whether the different projections arise
# from the same or different populations. Multipolar cells are a major source of
# input from the cochlear nucleus to the contralateral inferior colliculus
# [2,12,24,33,37,102,154,156,191,205]. It seems likely

# that most, if not all, type I multipolar cells participate in this projection
# [102]. The projection arises from neurons throughout the VCN, including all but
# the most anterior part of the AVCN and the octopus cell area in the PVCN. The
# same neurons that project to the inferior colliculus also send collateral
# branches to the DCN ([4],also, [55,61,167,217]). In both targets, the synaptic
# terminals contain round synaptic vesicles, compatible with an excitatory effect
# (IC: [154],DCN: [220]). The projections from the cochlear nucleus have been
# shown to directly contact neurons in the inferior colliculus that project to the
# medial geniculate nucleus [156]. A smaller projection to the ipsilateral
# inferior colliculus also arises from multipolar cells in the VCN
# (e.g., [2,154]). The axons that make up this projection travel in the trapezoid

**** Synaptic Inputs to T Stellate Cells


The driving excitatory inputs of \TS cells come from afferent \ANFs.  \ANFs
provide glutamatergic excitation using AMPA receptors
\citep{Cant:1981,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,Alibardi:1998a}.  AMPA \EPSCs have a
time constant of 0.36 ms in \TS and \DS cells, with a slight deviation in \TV
neurons (0.4 ms) \citep{Gardner:2000,GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}.  
\ANF synapses are commonly located on \TS cells' proximal dendrites and rarely
on the soma, which distinguishes them from \DS cells (cat
\citep{SmithRhode:1989}; mice \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,CaoOertel:2010};
chinchilla \citep{JosephsonMorest:1998}).  Variability in the number and location of
\ANF inputs to TS cells, and the type of \ANFs (\HSR or \LSR) results in a
heterogeneous classification of \TS cells based on their chopper-like
physiological responses \citep{SmithRhode:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.

Fast, glycinergic synapses arrive on TS cells from \DS and \TV cells
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,WickesbergOertel:1990,ZhangOertel:1993b}.
The \GlyR in \VCN and other auditory brainstem units has a faster rise time (0.4
ms) and decay time (2.5 ms) compared with other glycinergic synapses in the
brain, which is critical for fast encoding of sounds
\citep{LimOleskevichEtAl:2003,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,LeaoOleskevichEtAl:2004,HartManis:1998}.
The function of \DS cell inputs has been suggested to include: wide-band lateral
suppression (especially in noise) \citep{RecioRhode:2000a,RhodeGreenberg:1994a};
enhancement of modulated inputs by providing phase-locked inhibition
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994,Rhode:1994}; enhancement of the volley by suppressing
the first spike in lateral side-bands of a spectrum
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003,JorisSmith:2008}; and enhancement of voice onset
encoding \citep{ClareyPaoliniEtAl:2004}. The function of \TV cells in the \CN
stellate microcircuit has been hypothesised to include: narrow-band inhibition
around low level tones and band-pass noise \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999};
delayed, echo-suppression
\citep{BurckHemmen:2007,ParhamZhaoEtAl:1998,WickesbergOertel:1990}; and spectrum
modification around notch noise gaps \citep{ReissYoung:2005}.  In mice, \TS
cells have been found to excite \TV cells in several intracellular studies
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990,ZhangOertel:1993b} but \TS cell terminals are
absent on \TV cells in rats \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.  If this connection is 
present, this creates a complicated recurrent loop in the \CN stellate
microcircuit and would develop non-linear activity in the main output of the
network, \TS cells.

 *GABAergic Golgi cells*

- no \IPSPs or \IPSCs but presence of \GABAa receptors and response changes   to bicuculine   \citep{WuOertel:1986,OertelWickesberg:1993,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}
- dend filter obscures \PSPs
- Golgi cells are GABAergic and lie within the granule cell domains around   the \VCN and terminate near the fine distal dendrites of \TS cells

Sources of polysynaptic excitation, observed with late \EPSPs observed in \TS
cells, indicate that \TS cells receive excitatory input from excitatory
interneurons within the in \VCN \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. When
separated from their natural synaptic inputs, isolated axons cannot contribute
to polysynaptic responses.  Monosynaptic responses have latencies between 0.5
(synaptic delay) and 3 ms (2.5 ms conduction delay for an unmyelinated fibre of
0.5 mm plus 0.5 ms synaptic delay). Therefore \EPSPs with latencies of 3 ms are
polysynaptic and must be generated by excitatory interneurons
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Two other experimental observations confirm
this conclusion. As cut axons have not been observed to fire spontaneously, the
presence of spontaneous \EPSPs is an indication of the existence of excitatory
interneurons. Furthermore, the activation of \EPSPs with the application of
glutamate indicates that the dendrites of excitatory interneurons are accessible
from the bath.  \TS cells are excitatory neurons known to terminate in the
vicinity of \TS cells. \TS cells terminate locally in the multipolar cell area
of the \PVCN \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. This area is occupied by \TS
cells and occasionally \DS and bushy cells, some or all of which are therefore
presumably their targets. The ultrastructure of \TS cell terminals and
functional studies of the inputs to the inferior colliculi is consistent with
their being excitatory \citep{Oliver:1984,Oliver:1987,SmithRhode:1989}.

**** Major Ascending Output

\TS cell axons exit the \CN through the trapezoidal body, cross the midline and
 ultimately terminate in the contralateral \IC \citep{Adams:1979}. Other
 collaterals: local \VCN, \DCN, \LSO, c\VNTB c\VNLL

     direct to \TS is positive, but efferent \MOC-OHC-\ANF reduces activation of

The intrinsic cell properties show TS cells 
to be tonic and integrate inputs
\citep{Oertel:1983,OertelWuEtAl:1988,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Additional
properties of currents activated at rest (\Ih and \IKA) enhance the ability of
\TS cells to remain stable given AN adaptation, intra-nuclei inhibition and
regulation by extra-nuclei inputs \citep{RothmanManis:2003b,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

** Function of the Stellate Microcircuit

# *** Functional Role of Inhibition
\glsunset{GABA}

Glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition are thought to play different
spectro-temporal processing roles in the \CN.  Glycinergic inputs from \DS and
\TV cells are predominantly active at the onset of stimuli; accordingly, they
provide enhanced temporal acuity and dynamic range at onset.  Post-onset and
tonic inhibition is provided by \GABA inputs.  GABAergic inhibition acting on
slow and fast receptors (\GABAa and subtype B (GABA_B) respectively) is likely to
mediate the strong post-onset inhibition in \DS cells
 \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,EvansZhao:1998}.  \TS cells are weakly
inhibited by \GABA \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} reflecting the smaller
number of GABAergic synapses on their dendrites
 \citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003,SmithRhode:1989}.  GABAergic inhibition in
the \VCN derives from a number of possible sources, intrinsically from Golgi
cells in the granule cell layer of the \VCN or extrinsically from olivocochlear
efferents \citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}.

Axo-somatic inhibition from flat and pleomorphic terminals has been observed
adjoining prominently on \DS cells and could possibly explain the \OnC response
to tones and noise.  Evidence of axo-dendritic inhibition on \TS cells
 \citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989} led Sachs and colleagues to suggest that \TS
cells overcome saturation of high spontaneous rate \AN fibres by proximal
inhibitory inputs that shunt excitation from more distal inputs
 \citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987,WangSachs:1994}. This mechanism was explored using
steady-state continuous inputs \citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994} and there is strong
potential to explore this using more realistic inhibitory circuits.


GABAergic inhibition regulates the level of activity in the \VCN\space
\citep{PalombiCaspary:1992}. The application of bicuculine abolishes the onset
response of \OnC and \OnL units \citep{EvansZhao:1998,PalombiCaspary:1992}.
Bicuculine, a \GABAa antagonist, raises the threshold and significantly
increases the \OnC receptive field to high and low frequencies, to up to 10 times the
receptive field width of \AN fibres \citep{EvansZhao:1998}.  Facilitation of
response by spectral inputs outside the conventional receptive field
\citep{WinterPalmer:1995,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996} indicates the presence of tonic
inhibition in \OnC units.  Inhibition acting post-onset is likely to be a
dominant factor in their onset response properties rather than membrane-based
mechanisms \citep{EvansZhao:1998}.  \OnC showed little difference in response to
cosine or random phase harmonics, which improves temporal encoding of
fundamental in echoic situations \citep{EvansZhao:1998}. The post-onset
inhibition can last for up to 400 ms, as observed by hyperpolarisation of
the soma potential \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004} and a reduction in spontaneous
firing rate \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}. \citet{MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2004}
demonstrated the co-localisation of glycine and \GABA transporters by
immunofluorescence labelling of endings contacting spherical bushy cells. The
functional significance of co-localisation of these two inhibitory
neurotransmitters is uncertain, but it is possible that glycinergic transmission
may be modulated by the activation of pre- and post-synaptic \GABAa receptors
\citep{LimAlvarezEtAl:2000}.

Mixed glycine and \GABA terminals, with pleomorphic vesicles, have been
observed in the \VCN\space \citep{AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993}, but these are most likely
from \GABA and \GAD immunoreactive periolivary neurons whose axons terminate in
the \VCN\space (cats \citep{Adams:1983,SpanglerCantEtAl:1987}; guinea pig
\citep{HelfertBonneauEtAl:1989,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1990,Schofield:1991,QiuWangEtAl:1995};
rat \citep{CamposCaboEtAl:2001}).  Periolivary neurons receive afferent inputs
from monotonic units in the \VCN\space \citep{Schofield:1995,Schofield:2002} and are
thought to play a role in sound duration
\citep{DehmelKopp-ScheinpflugEtAl:2002,KadnerKuleszaEtAl:2006,KuleszaKadnerEtAl:2007}.

*** Synchronisation to Amplitude Modulated Tones 

\glsunset{fm}

The temporal \MTF measures the precision of phase-locking to envelope
modulations of a \CF tone by different modulation frequencies (\fm).  Frisina
and colleagues first showed that phase-locking to \AM in the \CN is enhanced
relative to the \AN\space \citep{Frisina:1983,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}.  A number of
studies have shown that the fundamental frequency is represented as an interval
code in most \CN units
\citep{CarianiDelgutte:1996,Rhode:1995,Rhode:1998}.  Modulated signals have been
used extensively to analyse temporal coding in the \CN\space 
\citep{Moller:1976,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,KimSirianniEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994,Rhode:1994}.
Some response types in the \CN preserve envelope information over a wide range
of stimulus levels, even above 100 dB \SPL, where \ANFs have reduced
synchronisation \citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1994,Rhode:1994}.

Studies of modulation in the \AVCN show a
hierarchy of enhancement: \OnC \to \ChS\slash \ChT \to \PL\slash \PLn
\citep{WangSachs:1994,Rhode:1998,RecioRhode:2000}. This enhancement is
relative; since choppers only phase-lock to modulations below 500Hz,
\PL and \PLn units perform better at higher modulation frequencies
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.


The dynamic range of chopper neurons to \AM tones (up to 90 dB) 
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a} is significantly greater than
individual \ANFs (30--40 dB) \citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1985}.
# The answer which is suggested by our model is that chop-
# per neurons receive input from onset neurons which
The change in \AM dynamic range may be due to a number of mechanisms in the
stellate microcircuit.  Selective processing of \HSR\slash \LSR fibres
\citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994} is one proposed mechanism,
however, this is unlikely due to the degradation of temporal information in
\ANFs at high \SPL\space \citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.  Inhibition from \DS cells
is a more likely mechanism. \DS cells integrate \ANFs over a wide frequency range
\citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,OertelBalEtAl:2000,GoldingFerragamoEtAl:1999},
enhance temporal information \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}, and have a large
dynamic range to tones \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}.  GABAergic \GLG cells have
a large dynamic range to tones and noise \citep{GhoshalKim:1996}, and are
proposed as a regulator of gain in the activity of \TS cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  These mechanisms have not been fully
explored and will be discussed further in Chapter \ref{sec:Chapter4}.


Chopper units generally have band-pass \tMTF at high \SPL, with the \fm inducing
the highest synchronisation called the \BMF\space \citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}.
Chopper units are important in the transition of a temporal-place code in the
\AN to a rate-based coding of \BMF in the \IC\space 
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}. Rhode and colleagues confirmed the presence of
band-pass \tMTFs as well as some band-pass rate-based \MTFs in chopper units in
the cat \citep{Rhode:1994,RhodeGreenberg:1994}. The \BMF of chopper units lie
between 50 and 500Hz \citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994}, which is
a critical in speech modulation and segregation of sounds \citep{Bregman:1990}.
\OnC units are well suited to encode a wide range of \fm with strong
synchronisation due their precise onset
\citep{KimRhodeEtAl:1986,JorisSmith:1998,RhodeGreenberg:1994,Rhode:1998}.

*** Vowel Representation in TS cells

The representation of vowels in the auditory periphery has been studied using
recordings from a large population of \ANFs
\citep{SachsYoung:1979,YoungSachs:1979,DelgutteKiang:1984,DelgutteKiang:1984a,DelgutteKiang:1984b,DelgutteKiang:1984c}
and \CN cells
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997,RecioRhode:2000}.  Reviews
of vowel encoding in the \VCN\space \citep{May:2003,PalmerShamma:2003} highlight
the spectral enhancement of formant peaks and suppression of formant troughs by
chopper units. Figure \ref{fig:May2003} shows the estimated rate-place
representation of \ANF and \VCN units.  \HSR\space \ANFs and primary-like \VCN
units show saturation of trough frequencies at moderate sound levels.  \LSR
units in the \AN and primary-like \VCN units are able to encode spectrum at high
\SPL\@.  The rate-place representation in chopper units (\ChS and \ChT) shows
considerable robustness, maintaining spectral peak information across a wide
range of intensity levels (right panels in Figure \ref{fig:May2003}).
Suppression of spectral troughs in the rate-place representation of \ChT and
\ChS units is greater than the suppression in \LSR\space \ANFs at high \SPL\@.
Spectral enhancement in \TS cells cannot be attributed to lateral suppression in
the \AN alone; it requires some form of lateral inhibitory mechanism that can
perform spectral enhancement by suppression of noise between peaks
\citep{Shamma:1985}.

Lateral inhibition of varying strengths is found in the responses of most cell
types in all divisions of the \CN\space 
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,Young:1984,RhodeGreenberg:1994a}.  \ChT\space \TS cells
exhibit strong side-band inhibition and respond to vowels with a clear and
stable representation of acoustic spectrum in their average firing rate at all
stimulus levels \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,MayPrellEtAl:1998,RecioRhode:2000}.
Selective listening to \LSR and \HSR\space \ANFs could be one possible
mechanism \citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987}.
\TS cells do receive inhibitory inputs
\citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} hence they are
candidates for operation of lateral inhibition.  Recurrent excitation by
\TS cells within the same frequency band could also increase the rate \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

Taken together, the experimental evidence demonstrates that there is much that
remains unknown about the functioning of neural processing in the \CNSM.

Advances in understanding \CN membrane
kinetics and improved understanding of the synaptic organisation have increased the feasibility of
investigations of synaptic influences more feasible \citep[cf.~][]{MeddisHewitt:1993}. Combined with massively
increased computational power available to researchers, a highly detailed model
can provide greater insight into the function of regulatory mechanisms within
and outside the cochlear nucleus. This knowledge can also drive methods for
constraining such detailed models based on physiological responses in other
neural networks of the brain.

*** Modelling of the Auditory Periphery

Computational models of \CN neurons requires adequate
representation of their inputs, \ANFs.  Models of the auditory periphery over
the last 30 years have expanded our understanding of the mechanical processes in
the middle ear and cochlea, and the specialised synapse between the \IHC and the \AN\space 
\citep{DavisVoigt:1991,Carney:1993,MeddisHewittEtAl:1990}. Modelling in the
auditory periphery has benefited extensively from the work of Liberman,
Greenwood, Patterson, Young, Sachs and others, in acoustic /in vivo/
experiments.

A review by \citet{Lopez-Poveda:2005}, shows the two groups with the strongest correlation
between known phenomenological behaviour and model outputs are the DSAM model
\citep{Meddis:2006,MeddisHewittEtAl:1990,SumnerLopez-PovedaEtAl:2002}\footnote{DSAM 
http://www.essex.ac.uk/psychology/department/HearingLab/modelling.html} and the
Carney model
\citep{Carney:1993,TanCarney:2001,ZhangHeinzEtAl:2001,HeinzZhangEtAl:2001,TanCarney:2003,JacksonCarney:2005,ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009,ZilanyCarney:2010,ZilanyBruce:2006}\footnote{Carney
model
http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/Carney-Lab/publications/auditory-models.cfm}.
These models both show good representation of rate behaviour in \LSR and \HSR models, as well as temporal phenomena in ANFs.
This thesis uses the Carney model for all \AN simulations.

*** Single neuron models of the chopper unit

A number of neural models of \CN neurons have been developed.  The basic
approaches include point neuron models
\citep{ArleKim:1991,HewittMeddisEtAl:1992} and conductance based, \HH-like
compartmental models
\citep{BanksSachs:1991,WhiteYoungEtAl:1994,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,WangSachs:1995}.
Point neuron models based on \citet{MacGregor:1993} were able to replicate
intrinsic chopping behaviour \citep{ArleKim:1991,HewittMeddisEtAl:1992} and
synchronisation to stimulus envelope \citep{GhoshalKimEtAl:1992} with simple
mathematical models.  Little was known about the specialised potassium and
sodium currents in the \VCN before
\citet{WhiteYoungEtAl:1990,ManisMarx:1991}. \citet{BanksSachs:1991} used
modified \HH equations \citep{HodgkinHuxley:1952} to develop a fast sodium
(\INa) current and a high-threshold (\IKHT) potassium current. Further
modifications of the \citet{BanksSachs:1991} conductance model improved the
adaptive chopping behaviour due to inhibition
\citep{WangSachs:1995,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994} and the model's synchronisation to
envelope \citep{WangSachs:1995}.

 
A single compartment model with accurate membrane conductances was developed
based on whole cell recordings in \VCN neurons \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The
voltage-gated ionic currents that give the cell its chopping behaviour are the
major mechanism contributing to the electrical activity of stellate cells
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}. \citet{RothmanManis:2003b}
presented three new current models from whole cell recordings in the \VCN
(hereafter called the 'RM' neural model).  These included the low-threshold
potassium current (\IKLT), the transient potassium current (\IKA) and the
hyperpolarisation-activated mixed cation current (\Ih). \IKA and \Ih have a role
in modulating the response of \TS cells, enhancing their sensitivity to small
input changes.


# FROM ROTHMAN 2003c Because little was known about the Naϩ and Kϩ currents in VCN
# stellate cells before 1991, Banks and Sachs used modified
# versions of the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) equations (1952),
# which included a fast Naϩ current (INa) and a high-threshold
# K current (IHT). Wang and Sachs (1995) presented a modified
# version of the Banks and Sachs stellate cell model where, to
# account for a higher spike threshold observed in vitro, the
# activation curves of INa and IHT were shifted 10 mV positive.
# Arle and Kim (1991) and Hewitt et al. (1992) presented
# “MacGregor-type” stellate cell models in which IHT was
# treated as a digital entity; that is, it was “on” during an action
# potential (AP) but “off” at other times. In general, the preced-
# ing HH-like and MacGregor-like stellate models were success-
# ful in that they replicated many of the response characteristics
# of stellate cells in vitro and in vivo. For example, during a
# depolarizing current pulse, the models exhibited repetitive fir-
# ing (i.e. a Type I current-clamp response) and when stimulated
# with auditory-nerve-like synaptic input, the models exhibit a
# “chopping” response in their poststimulus time histograms
# (PSTHs), reflecting their regular discharge. These models were
# also successful in replicating responses to more complex stim-
# uli (Arle and Kim 1991; Hewitt et al. 1992; Wang and Sachs
# 1995).
# \yellownote{Paragraph on Rothman and Manis Current Models in VCN Bushy and Stellate Cells}
# Present a robust model of \VCN neurons based on previous experimental studies.
# The RM neural model presents a robust model of \VCN neurons and replicates behaviour including 
# - current clamp responses of type I (stellate cells) and type II (bushy cells) units.
# - \PSTH responses solely based on sub- or supra-threshold excitation at the soma
# - phase locking capabilities of neurons (simulated steady state input)
# - Derived from a complete characterisation of K+ currents rather than ad hoc assumptions: hence more accurate.  The greatest difference between the previous models is voltage dependent \IKHT and \IKLT currents.
# - \IKA has a role in modulating the rate of repetitive firing. Increasing \gKA counteracted depolarising effects of EPSPs, thereby increasing threshold for \AP.  Effects of inhibition on \TS cells could be to reset \IKA
# - \IKLT plays a role in type II by reducing input resistance hence reducing the membrane time constant.  In intermediate type I-i cells small amount of \IKLT had a greater affect on rate of firing than \IKA. Small \IKLT could also benefit neurons by reducing EPSPs near the axon hillock and reducing \AP back propagation in proximal dendrites.
# - Modulation of \IKLT: Coincidence detection neurons would benefit from \IKLT up-regulation to reduce membrane time constant, reduce EPSP height and width.  Enhanced temporal acuity at onset, reduced firing during sustained period, reduced spontaneous activity, reduction in refractory period that leads to faster firing rates.  Increasing \IKLT drops Vrev, hence Ih must be used to counterbalance \IKLT.

*** Microcircuit Models in the Cochlear Nucleus

# These models have been used to explore some basic responses of
# stellate cells seen physiologically, for example:
# - Simple regular chopping behaviour \citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994,ArleKim:1991,HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,BanksSachs:1991}
# - Adaptive chopping behaviour due to inhibition \citep{WangSachs:1995,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994}
# - Enhancement of dynamic range relative to \ANFs using combinations of \HSR and \LSR fibres \citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,ErikssonRobert:1999}
# - Effects of lateral inhibition \citep{Shamma:1985,ErikssonRobert:1999,PressnitzerMeddisEtAl:2001}

Table \ref{tab:ModellingCNTable} summarises neural network studies of the
\VCN with emphasis on the output of \TS cells.  Studies investigating \TS cells
with local interneurons have not utilised the important membrane cell properties
of \TS cells, are limited by outdated input \AN models, have insufficiently complex neural
models, or contain errors in their network connectivity.

The first network models of the \CN were in the \DCN\space 
\citep{DavisVoigt:1991,ArleKim:1990,ArleKim:1991a,Arle:1992}.  The
cerebellar-like circuitry of the \DCN and its complex \EIRA cell type
behaviours were modelled by Blum and colleagues
\citep{BlumReed:2000,BlumReed:1998,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1995}
and in greater detail by Davis and colleagues
\citep{DavisVoigt:1996,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:2001}.
The role of \DS cell inhibition in the \DCN circuitry, particularly on \TV cells
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}, is critically important to the \VCN stellate
microcircuit.  Strong, fast, wide-band inhibition of \TV cells induces non-linear
rate-level response to tones and minimal response to noise.  The topological
properties of \DS to \TV connectivity have been explored even further, with
suggestions of an offset of the \DS connections from high \CF to low \CF
frequency bands \citep{ReissYoung:2005,LomakinDavis:2008,YoungDavis:2002}.

Selective processing of different \ANF inputs using some form of inhibition was
the first step toward including interneurons in a \TS cell model
\citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994a,WangSachs:1995}.
\citet{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994a} used the ball and stick \HH conductance neural
model based on \citet{BanksSachs:1991}.  The mechanism of selective processing
removes the saturation of \HSR fibres by shunting inhibition at synapses
proximal to the soma.  This group of models enhanced the dynamic range of the
\TS cell model to tones and highlighted the need for inclusion of inhibitory
interneurons in \VCN models.

Lateral inhibition has been a strong feature in most \VCN network models.
\citet{Shamma:1985} first proposed lateral inhibition in the auditory pathway as
a means of enhancing rate-place processing, and led to biologically-inspired
automatic speech recognition models
\citep{Shamma:1998,XuZhouEtAl:2011}.
# The only model to consider a network with \TV and \DS
# cells in a \VCN chopper model was \citet{ErikssonRobert:1999}.
The \VCN stellate network model developed by \citet{ErikssonRobert:1999} was the
first to include topographically connected \TV and \DS cells.  This model
included a simplistic \AN model \citep{RobertEriksson:1999} but was still able
to reproduce chopper-like \PSTH and rate-level responses to tones.
# , a
# simplified version of existing phenomenologically based ANF models

Recurrent excitation between \TS cells has been observed in mice
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} and has been investigated in two modelling
studies \citep{BahmerLangner:2006,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}. Neither study provides a
realistic implementation of the stellate microcircuit, however.  In a
speculative model, \citet{WiegrebeMeddis:2004} included a range of \TS cells in
each frequency band, each with a different intrinsic firing rate.  The goal of
their model was decoding \AM properties in the \IC\@.  Unfortunately, the
intrinsic firing rate of the \TS cell model exceeded physiologically observed
rates.  Additionally, the \AN model used was limited by the dated nature of the
experimental data \citep{MeddisOMardEtAl:2001}.  


The network model by \citet{BahmerLangner:2006} proposed a new \VCN network
design, with an excitatory onset unit contacting recurrently connected \TS
cells.  The purpose of this model was to show that recurrently connected \TS
cells, with synaptic delay of 0.4 ms, form the best basis for modulation
frequency peaks in the \IC\@.  \citet{BahmerLangner:2006} assert that octopus
cells form excitatory synapses with \TS cells.  Octopus cells do not have axonal
collaterals in the \VCN\space \citep{Adams:1997,CantBenson:2003}; consequently, the
inclusion of octopus cells in a network of the \VCN is speculative. Despite
using the most up-to-date currents in the onset neural model
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}, \citet{BahmerLangner:2006a} failed to include the
\Ih current, a unique characteristic of octopus cells \citep{CaiMcGeeEtAl:2000}.
Recurrent networks in the cortex prefer inhibition for synchronisation
\citep{LyttonSejnowski:1991,BushSejnowski:1996}.  In theoretical terms,
inhibitory phasic input is significantly better than excitatory phasic inputs at
improving synchronisation in recurrent neural networks
\citep{VreeswijkAbbottEtAl:1995}. The lack of inclusion of contemporary \AN
models as input to the \citet{BahmerLangner:2006a} CN model means that there is
much scope for improvement in computational modelling in the \CN stellate
microcircuit.


** Optimisation in Neural Modeling

Neuronal modelling consists of a series of design choices, guesses and
assumptions that try to balance the level of detail in the model with the
accuracy and realism of the output \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}. Reviews of
spiking networks and \BNNs show there a many problems with optimisation of
parameters in these models \citep{EggertHemmen:2001,Brette:2007}. Increasing the
complexity of neural models and networks of synaptic connections creates large
parameter spaces. Large networks may use randomisation for synaptic connectivity
between cell populations which introduces indeterminate noise.  Noise is present
at multiple stages in \BNNs that create additional problems for optimisation.
These include stimulus noise, Poisson noise in neural \AP signals, background
noise from extrinsic inputs, synaptic noise in vesicle release probabilities,
and many others.  Without limitations and constraints on parameters and an
efficient optimisation technique these problems can become computationally
difficult.

Current methods used in constraining spiking networks can be categorised as follows:
 - \textbf{Self-organising maps (SOM)} are used in artificial neural networks for
   finding topographic relationships between feature detectors (input layers)
   and some sensory or abstract feature output
   \citep{Kohonen:2001}. There are two major difficulties in applying
   SOMs to realistic neural networks: the SOM does not transfer signal patterns
   due the singular response of the `winner-take-all' function
   \citep{Kohonen:2006} and \HH models are not analytical (in terms
   of its input\slash{}output relationship), rendering SOMs unsuitable for error
   back-propagation.
 - \textbf{Reverse correlation and principal component analysis} can be grouped
   into a class of statistical methods that use covariance in network activity
   to infer underlying connectivity
   \citep{DahlhausEichlerEtAl:1997,Chichilnisky:2001,EichlerDahlhausEtAl:2003}.
 - \textbf{Information Theoretic Analysis} includes coherence-based causality
   chains and directed transfer functions that can be used to identify feedback
   relationships between neurons
   \citep{KaminskiDingEtAl:2001,KorzeniewskaManczakEtAl:2003}.
#  , uses Granger causality (Granger, 1969) to expose the direction of information flow. Further two more methods: direct causality (), and direct directed  have been introduced. These methods allow identifying the presence of feedback between two or more neurons, but coupling polarities are not directly accessible. Although these methods have been successfully applied on simulated networks of randomly spiking coupled neurons, their application to real data is basically limited because: (i) they do not allow resolving mutual couplings between neurons and/or do not distinguish the type of such couplings; (ii) as a rule their application assumes the use of relatively large spike trains with constant statistical properties, a condition difficult to be satisfied in the experiments; (iii) they usually fail when applied to excessively rhythmic neural assemblies, a rather common situation which may just represent an objective of the research.all these methods deal only with the connectivity patterns, i.e. only presence and sometime type and direction of the couplings between neurons can be estimated. No knowledge about absolute values of couplings or other parameters of the network can be drawn.
 - \textbf{Single Neuron Dynamics} determine the effects of the activity of a
   network on \BNNs
   \citep{PillowPaninskiEtAL:2005}. \citet{MakarovPanetsosEtAl:2005} extended this method to include
   observation of neural architecture derived from extracellular recordings.
 - \textbf{Evolutionary algorithms} has been shown to be suitable for noisy,
   large parameter spaces of spiking neural networks
   \citep{TakahamaSakai:2005,Yao:1999}. \GAs have been used to constrain
   parameters in single cell models
   \citep{KerenPeledEtAl:2005,VanierBower:1999,VanDeEtAl:2008} or small \BNNs
   \citep{TaylorEnoka:2004}.

* Overview of Thesis

As the foregoing literature review has demonstrated, current \TS cell
microcircuit models make insufficient use of experimental data and optimisation
techniques. This thesis seeks to address these deficiencies through the design and
optimisation of the \CNSM model.  The remainder of this chapter introduces the
work undertaken in this thesis to develop and test the \CNSM model.

Chapter 2 establishes the general methods for use in the design of the \CNSM
model.  It introduces the basic building blocks of individual cells (membrane
currents, different cell types and characteristics), and their neural
connectivity (including synapse types and kinetics), and cell type to cell type
connections within and across frequency channels.  The
chapter describes the the \AN input model and the stimuli used to generate
acoustic input to the \AN model.  Finally, it foreshadows the optimisation
techniques deployed in Chapters 3 and 5.

Chapter 3 presents the detailed design of the \CNSM model using a sequential
method of optimisation. The cells of the \CNSM model (Golgi, \DS, \TV and 3
categories of \TS cells) and the cost function used to fit the model to
experimental data are each laid out in turn.  The \CNSM model was tested using a
series of tone and noise stimuli for validation with experimental data not
utilised in the optimisation procedure.


Chapter 4 presents a case study involving the validation of the \CNSM model
using complex stimuli, \AM, which is a key component of animal communication.
Through this application of the \CNSM, Chapter 4 demonstrates that connectivity
within the microcircuit enhances temporal coding from the \AN to higher centres
through the \TS cells.

Chapter 5 uses a simplified version of the \CNSM model to explore simultaneous
optimisation, a faster means of establishing network parameters in \BNNs.
Through this analysis, Chapter 5 demonstrates that \GAs may have utility as an
expedient optimisation method for large \BNNs, even where experimental data are
limited.


Chapter 6 draws together the findings of the design, optimisation and analysis of the
CNSM model. It describes the usefulness of the model as well as the optimisation
methods used throughout the thesis. It canvases the limitations of the research
and makes recommendations for future work arising out of the thesis.
