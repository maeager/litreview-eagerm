* Literature Review  
  
The development of biophysically-realistic neural network models is a
major objective of computational neuroscience.  Recent advances in the
field have meant that this goal is now more achievable than it has ever
been before.  In the auditory system, the high fidelity of acoustic
information mean synaptic interactions on the millisecond scale are
needed to modulate activity to enhance the representation of the
stimulus spectrum and temporal periodicities. In the \CN, the first
processing stage in the auditory brainstem, histological and
pharmacological labelling techniques have produced a flood of
information about the anatomy, physiology, immunohistochemistry,
pharmacology and intrinsic membrane properties of the different cell
types.  The synaptic organisation of cells in the cochlear nucleus has
been examined in detail in various species (cat:
\citealt{Cant:1981,TolbertMorest:1982,SaintMorestEtAl:1989}, mice:
\citealt{WickesbergOertel:1988,WickesbergOertel:1990,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991},
guinea pigs: \citealt{JuizHelfertEtAl:1996a,OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997},
rats: VCN \citealt{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003,RubioJuiz:2004}).
Physiological studies combined with labelling have given greater
certainty to correlations between physiological response types and
morphological cell types
\citep[e.g.,~][]{SmithRhode:1989,OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.
Intracellular recordings have ascertained the electrical properties and
the different synaptic inputs of \TS, \DS and \TV cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}.  Descriptions of
current dynamics for synaptic receptors
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999,HartyManis:1998} and membrane channels
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a} specific to the \VCN enable
accurate mathematical models to be developed at the cell and synaptic
level.  With this information a realistic biological model of the
stellate network is attainable and can provide further insight into
processing of acoustic information.


\Gls{TS} cells of the \VCN encode a robust representation of the
stimulus spectrum in their average rate and a temporal representation
essential for speech \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}. They project
directly to the inferior colliculus, and are therefore important in
conveying information to higher auditory centres. \TS cells are known to
form a local microcircuit network with neurons within its isofrequency
lamina and across the frequency range of the nucleus. The microcircuit
includes \DS cells, a wide-band inhibitory cell in the \VCN, \TV cells,
a narrowband inhibitory cell in the \DCN, and Golgi cells, a GABAergic
neuron in the outer granule shell of the \CN
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}. Inhibition is
known to play a key role in shaping the average rate response,
synchronisation to modulation and onset delay of cells in the cochlear
nucleus
\citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,EvansZhao:1998,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.


The intrinsic behaviour of \TS cells are basically integrators, which
allows phasic input from \ANFs to be converted to a tonic or chopping
output.  The tonic behaviour suits encoding of spectrum across
population since encoding the peaks and valleys is relatively
independent of time after onset of sound; and also suits encoding of
envelope of sounds, which is important for speech
\citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  Presence of active membrane channels at
rest means that \TS cells are sensitive to neuromodulatory currents
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,FujinoOertel:2001,RothmanManis:2003}
and increases its response time to temporally important features like
vowel transitions and glottal pulses
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004,ClareyPaoliniEtAl:2004}.  The average
discharge rate of the two chopper populations provide either a ‘high
contrast’ representation independent of level (\ChS) or a level
dependent, ‘low contrast’ representation of stimulus spectrum (\ChT)
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003}.  The temporal coding of cells in
the cochlear nucleus has also been studied extensively with AM tones
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,RhodeGreenberg:1994},
and ripple noise \citep{WinterPalmerEtAl:1993}; however, it was
\citet{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997} who went further in showing that
chopper cells provide a periodicity-tagged spectral representation that
can be used to separate simultaneously presented vowels.


The fundamental rhetorical question in the literature comes down to
whether intrinsic membrane mechanisms or network and synaptic mechanisms
are more important for the behaviour of \TS cells
\citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  Other important questions may need to be
addressed first: What mechanisms in \TS cells are essential for
sustained firing to constant sound level despite significant adaptation
in \ANF input?  How are the different categories of \ANFs (\LSR and
\HSR) processed by \TS cell microcircuit?  Is the loss of temporal
information at high frequencies due to intrinsic properties or tonic
inhibition and to what extent does this influence higher auditory
systems?  What is the functional difference between the heterogeneous
\TS cell population (i.e., \ChT and \ChS units)?  What is the purpose of
the polysynaptic recurrent inhibition between Golgi, \DS and \TV cells,
and what is their direct influence on \TS cells?  What are the effects
of asymmetric or non-Gaussian topographic connections across
isofrequency laminae and how does this effect the spectral
representation across the population of \TS cells?  The purpose of
developing the network surrounding \TS cells is to answer these
questions.

This thesis investigates the important physiological mechanisms involved in the
processing of sounds. It achieves this through the development and testing of a novel 
\CNSM model.
focuses specifically on the spectral and temporal enhancement, in the
cochlear nucleus stellate microcircuit of mammals.  Computer modelling enhances
our knowledge of complex neural interactions in \TS cells and provides further
understanding of inputs to higher centres.  The cochlear nucleus stellate
network contains many independent simple components that are combined in
non-linear feedback and feed-forward processes.  Intuition and simple
calculation cannot serve to predict the response of such a complex system,
therefore a more complex model must be used.  A biological neural network that
contains a high degree of realism at the individual cell level may contribute to
our knowledge of synaptic organisation in producing physiological behaviour.
The complexity of synaptic organisation is compounded by inter-species and
within-species variation in computer models. Variation is managed by
constraining the parameters to a range of values to elicit physiological
behaviour observed in vivo.

The implications of lateral inhibition and recurrent excitation on
signal processing by \TS cells are two fold: enhanced spectral
representation and enhanced synchronisation to the fundamental
frequency.  The physiological and signal processing significance of
particular components in the network are addressed in the three
hypotheses of this thesis.  Rate-place representation of vowel spectrum
are analysed for the effects of lateral inhibition and recurrent
excitation.  Spectral shape enhancement is important for a stable
representation of stimulus spectrum to be conveyed to higher auditory
centres. Clarifying the roles of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition
contributes to the understanding of spectral and temporal influences of
inhibitory circuits in the cochlear nucleus.

Higher processing stages in the auditory system also perform advanced
auditory processing, to whatever extent it is limited by the information
contained at the bottleneck of the auditory nerve.  Therefore, signal
processing done by lateral inhibition and recurrent excitation in the
cochlear nucleus has a significant influence on perception at higher
levels of auditory processing.  Understanding the complex processing
done by the cochlear nucleus may also contribute to understanding the
limitations of hearing-impairment devices.  Further understanding how
the processing of sound in noisy environments works within the network
could aid in developing new sound processing strategies for the cochlear
implant and hearing aids.


* Auditory System 

Speech is a unique and fundamental tool in communication between humans.
We continually deal with various distortions of the acoustic environment
(e.g., background noise and reverberation) to extract information from
signals entering the ear.  Vowels provide a salient feature of speech
that is spectrally and temporally distinct from other natural sounds.
The spectrum of each vowel is distinguished by the location of high
energy spectral peaks called formants. Robust representation of spectrum
at different intensities is important for speech and other auditory
communication \citep{YoungOertel:2004}.  The main tasks of the auditory
system are to (1) separate out individual frequency components of sound;
(2) enhance spectral and temporal contrasts to improve meaningful \SNR;
and (3) extract behavioural frequency cues \citep{Evans:1992}.

Advanced auditory fidelity and localisation is an exceptional feature of
hearing perception in animals.  This speciality works to a high degree
despite the input at the round window of the cochlea being one
dimensional and very noisy.  Rough frequency decomposition is performed
by the basilar membrane and organ of Corti in the mammalian cochlea,
which transforms mechanical signals to neural signals in \ANFs.  The
next element of the auditory process occurs in the cochlear nucleus, the
first processing stage of the central auditory pathway in which all
\ANFs end. Enhancing spectral and temporal contrasts requires
sophisticated parallel processing strategies involving networks of
neurons with feed-forward and feed-back connections.


The auditory system is topographically ordered from the basilar membrane
to the cortex in terms of frequency selectivity, also called
tonotopicity \citep{YoungOertel:2004}.  The population of auditory nerve
fibres (ANFs, Figure \ref{fig:CNCatHuman}) bifurcate after entering the
cochlear nucleus to innervate the \VCN and \DCN, retaining their
tonotopic order \citep{Lorente:1981,Liberman:1982,Liberman:1993}.  Type
1 \ANFs are categorised into \HSR and \LSR fibres \citep{Liberman:1978},
where \LSR fibres have a higher threshold and wider dynamic range than
\HSR fibres.  They also project to the \GCD
\citep{RyugoParks:2003,RyugoHaenggeliEtAl:2003} along with the smaller,
unmyelinated type 2 \ANFs, which suggests they play a different role in
sound processing to \HSR fibres.

** Auditory Nerve Fibres

# \todo[inline]{Small and concise lit review of ANFs}

# \todo[inline]{1 para on Spontaneous discharge rate (SR). More work on references here} 

The acoustic physiology of auditory nerve fibres form a bimodal
distribution where 30--40\% of the fibres have \SR less than 2 spikes
per second and 60--70\% have \SR above 30 spikes/s
\citep{RyugoParks:2003}. Threshold is correlated to the amount of
spontaneous spike activity that occurs in the absence of
experimenter-controlled stimulation. \LSR fibres have relatively high
thresholds, whereas \HSR fibres have low thresholds. Across the
audible frequency range, fibres of similar \CFs can vary in \SR from
near 0 to 100 spikes/s.  The bimodal \SR distribution is present
across the entire audible frequency range for the animal, and implies
a general organisational principle for the mammalian auditory
nerve. Fibres of the different \SR groupings exhibit distinct
physiologic features, especially in terms of their contribution to the
dynamic range of hearing and representation of speech sounds
\citep[see~][for review]{RyugoParks:2003}. The collective evidence
suggests that different \SR groupings of auditory nerve fibres serve
separate roles in acoustic information processing. It might be that
the \HSR fibres with their low thresholds prefer to function in quiet,
whereas \LSR fibres with their high thresholds operate better in loud
and noisy environments.

The morphology of LSR and HSR are essentially similar. Characterised
as a bipolar neuron, their cell bodies lie in the retinal ganglion
region (Rosenthal's canal) of the cochlea and their peripheral process
contacting one inner hair cell.

The axonal process is part of the auditory nerve (CN VII) enters the
 central nerous barriervariable distance into the nucleus, depending
 upon fibre \CF, and bifurcate into an ascending branch and a
 descending branch. The ascending branch has a relatively straight
 trajectory into the \AVCN and terminates as a large, axosomatic
 ending called the endbulb of Held.  The descending branch passes
 through the \PVCN and octopus cell region before entering the \DCN.
# Along the
# way, these main branches give rise to short collaterals. The
# collaterals ramify further and exhibit en passant swellings
# and terminal boutons. 
Fibres of similar \CFs disperse to form a 3-dimensional sheet running
 through the nucleus, and stacks of these sheets represent the
 isofrequency con- tours of the nucleus (Fig. \ref{fig:CNschematic}).

#The sheets have a
# horizontal orientation within the ventral cochlear nucleus
# but twist caudally to form parasagittal sheets in the DCN.
 These projections underlie the tonotopic organization of the resident
 neurons of the cochlear nucleus
 \citep[for~reviews~see~]{RyugoParks:2003}.


# 5. Structure-function correlates
# 5.1. SR and peripheral correlates
# Morphologic specializations have been found in the in-
# nervation pattern of inner hair cells with respect to SR fibre
# groupings. High-SR fibres (>18 spikes/s) have thick periph-
# eral processes that tend to contact the “pillar” side of the
# inner hair cell, whereas low-SR fibres (<18 spikes/s) have
# thin peripheral processes that tend to contact the modiolar
# side of the hair cell [98,111]. Furthermore, there is SR
# segregation within the spiral ganglion. Low-SR neurons
# tend to be distributed on the side of the scala vestibuli,
# whereas high-SR fibres can be found throughout the gan-
# glion [82,100]. These peripheral differences are maintained
# by the pattern of central projections, and embedded within
# the tonotopic organization.
# 5.2. SR and central correlates
# There are morphologic correlates that correspond to
# groupings of fibres with respect to SR. Compared to fibres
# of high SR (>18 spikes/s), fibres of low SR (<18 spikes/s)
# exhibit different innervation characteristics with the IHCs
# [99,111], give rise to greater collateral branching in the
# AVCN [51], emit collaterals that preferentially innervate
# the small cell cap [100,177], and manifest striking special-
# izations in the large axosomatic endings, the endbulbs of
# Held [185] and their synapses [178].
# The typical high-SR fibre traverses the nucleus and gives
# rise to short collaterals that branch a few times before
# terminating (Fig. 10A). There was a suggestion that projec-
# tions of the different SR groups might be segregated along
# a medial-lateral axis within the core of the AVCN [94] but
# single-unit labelling studies do not unambiguously support or
# refute this proposal [51,82,100,208]. There are usually one
# or two terminal endbulbs at the anterior tip of the ascending
# branch, and the remaining terminals appear as en passant
# swellings or terminal boutons. It is presumed that these
# swellings are sites of synaptic interactions with other neu-
# ronal elements in the cochlear nucleus. Approximately 95#
# of all terminal endings were small and round, definable as
# “bouton-like” [163]. The remaining endings were modified
# endbulbs that tended to contact the somata of globular bushy
# cells and large endbulbs of Held that contacted the somata
# of spherical bushy cells. In contrast to birds, low-frequency
# myelinated auditory nerve fibres in mammals give rise
# to endbulbs. Furthermore, the endbulbs of low-frequency
# fibres tend to be the largest of the entire population of
# fibres.

# There is a clear SR-related difference in axonal branch-
# ing and the number of endings. Low-SR fibres give rise to
# greater collateral branching in the AVCN compared to that
# of high-SR fibres [51,100,101,208]. In cats, the ascending
# branch of low-SR fibres give rise to longer collaterals, twice
# as many branches (there are approximately 50 branches per
# low-SR fibre compared to 25 per high-SR fibre), and twice as
# many bouton endings (Fig. 10B). These endings, while more
# numerous, are also smaller compared to those of high-SR
# fibres [163]. The greater total collateral length is illustrated
# by low-SR fibres that have an average of 5 mm of collaterals
# per ascending branch compared to 2.8 mm of collaterals per
# high-SR fibre [51]. The inference from these observations is
# that low-SR fibres contact more neurons distributed over a
# wider region of the cochlear nucleus than do high-SR fibres.
# If the perception of loudness is proportional to the num-
# ber of active neurons [195], then this branching differential
# may provide the substrate. The activation of high-threshold,
# low-SR fibres by loud sounds would not only increase the
# pool of active auditory nerve fibres but also produce a spread
# of activity throughout the AVCN. This recruitment would
# be useful because the discharge rate of high-SR fibres is al-
# ready saturated at moderate sound levels.
# There is no systematic difference in the average number
# of terminals generated by the descending branch with re-
# spect to fibre SR. Low-SR fibres do, however, have a wider
# distribution across the frequency axis in the DCN as com-
# pared to high-SR fibres [171]. The endings lie within the
# deep layers of the DCN, below the pyramidal cell layer, and
# terminate primarily within the neuropil. The average termi-
# nal field width for low-SR fibres is 230.5 ± 73 ␮m, whereas
# that for high-SR fibres is 87.2 ± 41 ␮m. The significance of
# terminal arborization differences between high- and low-SR
# fibres might be involved in details of isofrequency laminae.
# The relatively short and narrow arborization of high-SR,
# low-threshold fibres could occupy the center of the lamina
# and endow those neurons with lower thresholds and sharper
# tuning. In contrast, the longer and broader terminal field of
# low-SR fibres could preferentially innervate the “edges” of
# the lamina. This kind of organization might establish a func-
# tional segregation of units having distinct physiological fea-
# tures within an isofrequency lamina, as has been proposed in
# the inferior colliculus [161] and auditory cortex [184,186].

* Cochlear Nucleus 

The cochlear nucleus receives the primary ascending input from \ANFs and
contains a heterogeneous population of cell types.  Cell types have been
classified using criteria including morphology, immunohistochemistry,
synaptic organisation, response to acoustic stimuli and frequency tuning
\citep[see~reviews][]{RyugoParks:2003,CantBenson:2003,YoungOertel:2004}.
The two major divisions are the \VCN and \DCN.  The different
projections out of the nucleus reflect the highly specialised parallel
processing that is performed to extract particular acoustic information
contained in the auditory nerve.  The \DCN in mammals generally has a
cerebellar-like laminar structure with many interneurons, whereas the
\VCN consists of a magnocellular core and a marginal shell (otherwise
called the \GCD in rodents).  The marginal shell is thought to be
involved in regulating the gain in the magnocellular core from inputs
outside the \CN \citep{EvansZhao:1993,GhoshalKim:1997}.

Recent reviews of characterised cells have examined the association
between the corresponding projection characteristics and physiological
acoustic characteristics
\citep{CantBenson:2003,RyugoParks:2003,SmithMassieEtAl:2005,YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.
\citet{DoucetRyugo:2006} showed the limited number of \VCN multipolar
neuron studies that have performed physiological unit assessments as
well as classification of morphology via labelling. The \PSTH response
to short tone bursts was used to classified \CN neurons into
primary-like, chopper, or onset chopper
\citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1963,SmithJorisEtAl:1993,ShofnerYoung:1985,YoungRobertEtAl:1988,BlackburnSachs:1989}.


The afferent and intrinsic synaptic connectivity in the cochlear nucleus
have also shown wide interest in the literature
\citep[see~reviews][]{YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  The
network in Figure \ref{fig:CNschematic} shows the connections, regarded
in the literature with sufficient evidence, among cochlear nucleus that
are involved in modulating \TS cells.  The cells and their synaptic
interaction will be discussed in the following sections and will form
the basis of investigation for this thesis.

#** Cell Types



** T Stellate Cells

\TS cells lie in the core region of the \VCN, primarily in the
posteroventral section (\PVCN) with some in the posterior part of the
anteroventral section (\AVCN)
\citep{Osen:1969,Lorente:1981,BrawerMorestEtAl:1974,OertelWuEtAl:1990,DoucetRyugo:2006,DoucetRyugo:1997}.
\TS cells encode complex features of the stimulus that are important
for the recognition of natural sounds and are a major source of
excitatory input to the inferior colliculus
\citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.

# distinction between \TS and \DS cells is made by their axonal projections,
# dendritic projections, and their immunohistochemistry.


This section gives a brief description of \TS cells (and distinction
between \DS cells) including cell morphology, immuno-histochemistry,
intrinsic membrane properties, and synaptic contacts. The
determination of how theses elements contribute to the heterogeneous
acoustic behaviour in different chopper subtypes is still to be
discovered.


*** Morphology of T Stellate Cells

Histology staining of the cochlear nucleus began almost a century ago
\citep{Lorente:1933}, and the role of classification and naming of
distinct cell types began. Star-like cell bodies observed with Golgi
impregnation were called \textit{stellate} cells
\citep{Osen:1969}. Nissl staining showed the multiple dendritic
morphology of \TS and \DS cells, hence the name \textit{multipolar}
was adopted \citep{BrawerMorestEtAl:1974,Lorente:1981}. Multipolar
cells were also divided into two groups, disperse or clumped Nissl,
according to their cytoplasmic appearance in thionin-stained sections
\citep{Liberman:1991,Liberman:1993}.  Further nomenclature based on
dendritic differences into planar (\TS cells) and radial (\DS cells)
has also been suggested in rats
\citep{DoucetRyugo:1997,DoucetRyugo:2006}.

Distinction based on somatic innervation in multipolar neurons
separated them into two types: type I (few somatic) and type II (many
somatic and dendritic) \citep{Cant:1981}.  The axonal projections of
\DS cells' axons head dorsally toward the \DCN via the dorsal acoustic
stria (hence D in D stellate), while \TS cells leave the \CN ventrally
through the ventral acoustic stria or trapezoid body (hence T)
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990}. Some \DS cells are also commissural,
exiting the \CN via the dorsal acoustic stria and cross the midline to
terminate in the contralateral \CN
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,NeedhamPaolini:2007,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}.
# distinction between \TS and \DS cells is made by their axonal projections,
# dendritic projections, and their immunohistochemistry.


# \yellownote{More work to do here}

For consistency, the \TS cell modelled in this thesis represents each
of the various names given to neurons with similar characteristics (T
stellate, type 1 multipolar, planar, and chopper \PSTH units) in
different animals, with closest association with rodents and cats. The
\DS cell type includes all those previously named as \DS, type-2
multipolar, radial, and units classified as \OnC \PSTH units.

*** Intrinsic Mechanisms of T Stellate Cells

The intrinsic cell-based properties of \VCN neurons have typically
been investigated using /in vitro/ current clamp experiments
\citep{Oertel:1983,OertelWuEtAl:1988,ManisMarx:1991,WuOertel:1984}.
\TS cells are classified as type I due to the regularly spaced firing
of action potentials to steady depolarising current, and can be
classified as simple integrators.  They have a linear current-voltage
response
\citep{Oertel:1983,OertelWuEtAl:1988,ManisMarx:1991,RhodeOertelEtAl:1983,SmithRhode:1989,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}.
The response to strong negative current in \TS and \DS is
double-exponential, which shows the presence of
hyperpolarisation-activated mixed cation current \Ih
\citep{FujinoOertel:2001,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}.

The \TS action potential has a single exponential undershoot that
shows the absence of \IKLT, which is present strongly in bushy cells
and to a moderate degree in \DS cells
\citep{FengKuwadaEtAl:1994,ManisMarx:1991,WuOertel:1984,RothmanManis:2003}.
Low threshold potassium current in bushy cells is responsible for the
phasic response (i.e. \PSTH classified primary-like units) and in \DS
cells enhances coincidence detection at onset
\citep{ManisMarx:1991,RothmanManis:2003b}.


In recent experimentation of mice, a fast transient-deactivating
potassium current (\IKA) has been found only in \TS cells
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}.  \Ih
and \IKA are active at rest and play a role in modulating the rate of
repetitive firing of \TS cells \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The effect
of inhibition on \TS cells could be to reset \IKA
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}, thus priming cells for oncoming activation
\cite{KanoldManis:2001,KanoldManis:2005}.  This has been shown to
enhance place-coding across \TS cells by enhancing the first-responder
activation \cite{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.

*** Acoustic Responses of T Stellate Cells

\TS cells receive a narrow frequency band of \ANF inputs and have a
chopping response to \CF tone bursts
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,BlackburnSachs:1989}.  Few synaptic terminals
contact on their soma; the majority of inputs contact the proximal
dendrites \citep{Cant:1981}. \TS cells are the primary excitatory
output to the inferior colliculus
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.

The response to acoustic stimulation is measured from a \PSTH to short
tone bursts \citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989}.  The level of
tuning and suppression of neurons receptive field is examined using
the \EIRA method
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,SpirouYoung:1991,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungNelkenEtAl:1993,ArleKim:1991a}.

The regular-firing chopping pattern shown in Figure \ref{fig:chopping}
is characteristic of \TS cells. \ChS and \ChT are differentiated by
the regularity of discharge throughout the stimulus using the \CV
statistic \citep{YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  Recurrent excitation among
\TS cells of similar \CFs was first suggested by
\citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The small numbers of axonal
collaterals are confined to the same frequency band as their
dendrites, indicating recurrent connections are between cells encoding
a similar frequency
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  This could
compensate for rapid transient adaptation in auditory nerve
excitation, allowing a robust representation of the spectral energy
falling within the cell's response area to be transmitted to higher
centres.

# CantBenson
# The type I multipolar cells are narrowly tuned and respond to tone bursts with
# regular trains of action potentials, a response referred to as a
# "chopper" pattern (e.g.,
# [168,220]). Neurons that exhibit chopper responses can differ substantially in
# their dendritic morphology ([58,179,194],cf. [30]) which suggests that a further
# subdivision of this class of neurons may be possible. In mouse, the equivalent
# cells (T-stellate cells) appear to integrate input from the auditory nerve with
# that from other multipolar cells of both types

# [61]. In general, the response properties of chopper units suggest that they
# play an important role in encoding complex acoustic stimuli, perhaps including
# speech sounds (e.g., [26,131,180]).

# The projection pattern of type I multipolar cells is illustrated in Fig.
# 2F. The axons leave the cochlear nucleus via the trapezoid body
# [55,151,220,245], where they make up the ventral thin fibre component
# [31,215,245,248]. Possibly because they are thinner than the axons of the other
# cell types, there have been few reports of successful intra-axonal injections of
# these fibres so it is not entirely clear whether the different projections arise
# from the same or different populations. Multipolar cells are a major source of
# input from the cochlear nucleus to the contralateral inferior colliculus
# [2,12,24,33,37,102,154,156,191,205]. It seems likely

# that most, if not all, type I multipolar cells participate in this projection
# [102]. The projection arises from neurons throughout the VCN, including all but
# the most anterior part of the AVCN and the octopus cell area in the PVCN. The
# same neurons that project to the inferior colliculus also send collateral
# branches to the DCN ([4],also, [55,61,167,217]). In both targets, the synaptic
# terminals contain round synaptic vesicles, compatible with an excitatory effect
# (IC: [154],DCN: [220]). The projections from the cochlear nucleus have been
# shown to directly contact neurons in the inferior colliculus that project to the
# medial geniculate nucleus [156]. A smaller projection to the ipsilateral
# inferior colliculus also arises from multipolar cells in the VCN
# (e.g., [2,154]). The axons that make up this projection travel in the trapezoid
# lateral body tract [245,248]. Multipolar cells in the VCN give rise to
# projections to

# the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus in cat [215] or superior paraolivary nucleus
# in rat and guinea pig [64,201], to the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body
# [64,215] and to the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus
# [64,91,206,215]. The cells that give rise to these projections are probably the
# type I multipolar cells [218]. Although it has not been established definitely,
# it seems likely that these projections arise from the same cells that project to
# the inferior colliculus. Multipolar cells of unknown type project to the
# ipsilateral

# lateral superior olivary nucleus and the lateral periolivary region in cats
# [41,233,248]. In addition to their projection to the DCN, the type I multipolar
# cells give rise to extensive collateral branches within the VCN
# [4,61,151,220,238]. These appear to play an important role in shaping late
# responses of cells in the VCN to auditory nerve stimulation
# (e.g., [61]).{\textquotedblright}

*** Synaptic Inputs to T Stellate Cells

   - sensitive to neuromodulatory currents \citep{FujinoOertel:2001}
   - high input resistance \rightarrow amplify small current inputs
\citep{FujinoOertel:2001}
   - no \IKLT in \TS, \IKLT makes bushy and octopus insensitive to
steady currents \citep{OertelFujino:2001,McGinleyOertel:2006}
   - Ih higher in \TS & activated more at lower potentials than in
bushy and octopus, so that it is less active at rest
   - high resistance \rightarrow greater voltage changes in small
modulating current \rightarrow Ih can be modulated by G-protein
coupled receptors, hence making \TS more excitable when Ih activated
\citep{RodriguesOertel:2006}

**** Driving inputs

   - Proximal dendrites and at the soma:
     - \ANF provide glutamatergic excitation for \TS
\citep{Cant:1981,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,Alibardi:1998a}

but \TS terminals absent on \TV cells in rat microscopy study
       - if present this could directly regulate the sustained
activity in \TS cells

**** GABAergic Golgi cells

    - no \IPSPs or \IPSCs but presence of \GABAa receptors and
response changes to bicuculine
\citep{WuOertel:1986,OertelWickesberg:1993,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}
    - dend filter obscures \PSPs
    - Golgi cells are GABAergic and lie within the granule cell
domains around the \VCN and terminate near the fine distal dendrites
of \TS cells

**** Recurrent local excitation between T stellate cells

\todo[inline]{Needs correcting}

Sources of polysynaptic excitation, observed with late \EPSPs observed
in \TS cells, indicate that \TS cells receive excitatory input from
excitatory interneurons within the in \VCN
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. When separated from their natural
synaptic inputs, isolated axons cannot contribute to polysynaptic
responses.  Monosynaptic responses have latencies between 0.5
(synaptic delay) and 3 ms (2.5 ms conduction delay for an unmyelinated
fibre of 0.5 mm plus 0.5 ms synaptic delay). Therefore \EPSPs with
latencies of 3 ms are polysynaptic and must be generated by excitatory
interneurons \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Two other
experimental observations confirm this conclusion. As cut axons have
not been observed to fire spontaneously, the presence of spontaneous
\EPSPs is an indication of the existence of excitatory
interneurons. Furthermore, the activation of \EPSPs with the
application of glutamate indicates that the dendrites of excitatory
interneurons are accessible from the bath.  \TS cells are excitatory
neurons known to terminate in the vicinity of \TS cells. \TS cells
terminate locally in the multipolar cell area of the \PVCN
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. This area is occupied by \TS cells
and occasionally \DS and bushy cells, some or all of which are
therefore presumably their targets. The ultrastructure of \TS cell
terminals and functional studies of the inputs to the inferior
colliculi is consistent with their being excitatory
\citep{Oliver:1984,Oliver:1987,SmithRhode:1989}.

*** Major Ascending Output

*** Summary

In summary, steady depolarising current shows intracellular ability of
\TS cells to be tonic and integrate inputs
\cite{Oertel:1983,OertelWuEtAl:1988,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Additional
properties of currents activated at rest (\Ih and \IKA) enhance the
ability of \TS cells to remain stable given AN adaptation,
intra-nuclei inhibition and regulation by extra-nuclei inputs.


#  FIX - this is not yours

As a population, \TS cells encode the spectrum of sounds. They receive
acoustic input from the auditory nerve fibres. Several mechanisms
contribute to that transformation: Feed-forward excitation through
other \TS cells, co-activation of excitation and inhibition, reduction
in synaptic depression, and the amplification of excitatory synaptic
current over time through \NMDA receptors. They deliver that
information to nuclei that make use of spectral information.  \TS
cells terminate in the \DCN, to olivocochlear efferent neurons, to the
lateral superior olive, and most importantly to the contralateral
inferior colliculus. These targets use spectral information to
localise sounds, to adjust the sensitivity of the inner ear, and to
recognise and understand sounds.


# Birds also process sounds through
# neurons that resemble T stellate cells in their projections and also
# in their cellular properties, attesting to the fundamental importance
# that T stellate-like cells have for hearing in vertebrates.

** Function of the Stellate Microcircuit

*** Functional Role of Inhibition

The actions of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition are thought to
play different spectro-temporal processing roles in the cochlear
nucleus.  Glycinergic inputs from \DS and \TV cells are predominantly
active at the onset of stimuli; accordingly they provide enhanced
temporal acuity and dynamic range at onset.  Post onset and tonic
inhibition is provided by \GABA inputs.  GABAergic inhibition acting
on slow and fast receptors (\GABAa and GABAB respectively) is likely
to mediate the strong post-onset inhibition in \DS cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,EvansZhao:1998}.  \TS cells are
weakly inhibited by \GABA \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} reflecting
the smaller number of GABAergic synapses
\citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}.  GABAergic inhibition in the
\VCN is derived from a number of possible sources, intrinsically from
Golgi cells in the granule cell layer of the \VCN or extrinsically
from olivocochlear efferents \citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}.


Axo-somatic inhibition from flat and pleomorphic terminals has been
observed adjoining prominently on \DS cells and could possibly explain
the \OnC response to tones and noise.  Evidence of axo-dendritic
inhibition on \TS cells \citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989} led Sachs
and colleagues to suggest that \TS cells overcome saturation of high
spontaneous rate \AN fibres by proximal inhibitory inputs that shunt
excitation from more distal inputs
\citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987,WangSachs:1994}. This mechanism was
explored by using steady-state continuous inputs
\citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994} and using more realistic inhibitory
circuits \citep{EagerGraydenEtAl:2004}.


GABAergic inhibition regulates the level of activity in the \VCN
\citep{PalombiCaspary:1992}, The application of bicuculine abolishes
the onset response of \OnC and \OnL units
\citep{EvansZhao:1998,PalombiCaspary:1992}.  Bicuculine, a \GABAa
antagonist, raises the threshold and significantly increases \OnC
receptive field to high and low frequencies, up to 10 times the
receptive field width of \AN fibres \citep{EvansZhao:1998}.
Facilitation of response by spectral inputs outside the conventional
receptive field \citep{WinterPalmer:1995,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996},
indicate the presence of tonic inhibition in \OnC units.  Inhibition
acting post onset is likely to be a dominant factor in their onset
response properties rather than membrane based mechanisms
\citep{EvansZhao:1998}.  \OnC showed little difference in response to
cosine or random phase harmonics, which improves temporal encoding of
fundamental in echoic situations \citep{EvansZhao:1998}. The
post-onset inhibition can last for up to 200--400msec, as observed by
hyperpolarisation of the soma potential \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}
and a reduction in spontaneous firing rate
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}. \citet{MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2004}
demonstrated the co-localisation of glycine and \GABA transporters by
immunofluorescence labelling of endings contacting spherical bushy
cells. The functional significance of co-localisation of these two
inhibitory neurotransmitters is uncertain, but it is possible that
glycinergic transmission may be modulated by the activation of pre-
and postsynaptic \GABAa receptors \citep{LimAlvarezEtAl:2000}.


Mixed Glycine/\GABA terminals, observed with pleomorphic vesicles,
have been observed in the \VCN \citep{AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993}, but
these are most likely from \GABA and \GAD immunoreactive periolivary
neurons whose axons terminate in the \VCN (cats:

rat: \citealt{CamposCaboEtAl:2001}.  Periolivary neurons receive
afferent input from monotonic units in the \VCN
\citep{Schofield:1995,Schofield:2002} and are thought to play a role
in sound duration
\citep{DehmelKopp-ScheinpflugEtAl:2002,KadnerKuleszaEtAl:2006,KuleszaKadnerEtAl:2007}.

*** Synchronisation to Amplitude Modulated Tones


The temporal \MTF measures the precision of phase-locking to envelope
modulations of a \CF tone by different \fms.  Frisina and colleagues
first showed that phase-locking to \AM in the \CN is enhanced relative
to the auditory nerve \citep{Frisina:1983,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}.  A
number of studies have shown that the fundamental frequency is
represented as an interval code in most cochlear nucleus units
\citep{CarianiDelgutte:1996,Rhode:1995,Rhode:1998}.  Modulated signals
have been used extensively to analyse temporal coding in the cochlear
nucleus
\citep{Moller:1976,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,KimSirianniEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994,Rhode:1994}.
Some response types in the cochlear nucleus preserve envelope
information over a wide range of stimulus levels, even above 100 dB
\SPL, where \ANFs have reduced synchronisation
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1994,Rhode:1994}.

Studies of modulation in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus show a
hierarchy of enhancement: \OnC \to \ChS\slash \ChT \to \PL\slash \PLn
\citep{WangSachs:1994,Rhode:1998,RecioRhode:2000}. This enhancement is
relative, since choppers only phase-lock to modulations below 500Hz,
\PL and \PLn units perform better at higher modulation frequencies
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.


The dynamic range of chopper neurons to \AM tones
\citep[90~dB][]{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a} is significantly greater than
individual \ANFs \citep[30--40~dB][]{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1985}.
#The answer which is suggested by our model is that chop-
#per neurons receive input from onset neurons which
The change in \AM dynamic range may be due to a number of mechanisms
in the stellate microcircuit.  Selective processing of \HSR\slash \LSR
fibres \citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994} is one
proposed mechanism, however, this is unlikely due to the degradation
of temporal information in \ANFs at high \SPL
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.  Inhibition from \DS cells, a more
likely mechanism, who integrate \ANFs over a wide frequency range
\citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,OertelBalEtAl:2000,GoldingFerragamoEtAl:1999},
enhance temporal information \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}, and have a
large dynamic range to tones \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}.  GABAergic
\GLG cells have a large dynamic range to tones and noise
\citep{GhoshalKim:1996}, and are proposed as a regulator of gain in
the activity of \TS cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  These
mechanisms have not been fully explored and will be discussed further
in Chapter \ref{sec:Chapter4}.


Chopper units generally have band-pass \tMTF at high \SPL, with the
\fm inducing the highest synchronisation called the \BMF
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}. Rhode and colleagues confirmed
band-pass \tMTFs as well as some band-pass rate-based \MTFs in chopper
units in the cat \citep{Rhode:1994,RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  The \BMF of
chopper units lie between 50 and 500Hz (gerbil and cat).  \OnC units
are well suited to encode a wide range of fm with strong
synchronisation due their precise onset Kim
\citep{KimRhodeEtAl:1986,JorisSmith:1998,RhodeGreenberg:1994,Rhode:1998}.

- AM coding in choppers encoded over wide range of intensities
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}
   - other work in AM coding of CN neurons
\citep{Moller:1972,Moller:1974a,Moller:1974,MooreCashin:1974,Frisina:1984,PalmerWinterEtAl:1986,KimRhodeEtAl:1986,WinterPalmer:1990a,Palmer:1990,PalmerWinter:1992,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,Frisina:1983,GorodetskaiaBibikov:1985,RhodeGreenberg:1994,ShofnerSheftEtAl:1996,FrisinaKarcichEtAl:1996,DAngeloSterbingEtAl:2003,Aggarwal:2003}
- phasic firing in AN maintained by bushy
   - phasic info important: enhances formant transitions, and provides
accurate information about the location of sound sources even in
reverberant environments, critical in hearing
\cite{DelgutteKiang:1984,DelgutteKiang:1984a,DelgutteKiang:1984b,DelgutteKiang:1984c,DelgutteKiang:1984d,DavoreIhlefeldEtAl:2009}

*** Vowel Representation in the Auditory Periphery

The representation of vowels in the auditory periphery has been
studied using recordings from a large population of auditory nerve
fibres
\citep{SachsYoung:1979,YoungSachs:1979,DelgutteKiang:1984,DelgutteKiang:1984a,DelgutteKiang:1984b,DelgutteKiang:1984c}
and cochlear nucleus cells
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997,RecioRhode:2000}.
Recent reviews of vowel encoding in the \VCN
\citep{May:2003,PalmerShamma:2003} highlighted the spectral
enhancement of formant peaks and suppression of formant troughs by
chopper units. Figure \ref{fig:May2003} shows the estimated rate-place
representation of auditory nerve and \VCN units.  \HSR \ANFs and
primary-like \VCN units show saturation of trough frequencies at
moderate sound levels.  \LSR units in the \AN and \LSR primary-like
\VCN units are presumably able to encode spectrum at high \SPL.  The
rate-place representation in chopper units (\ChS and \ChT) show
considerable robustness maintaining spectral peak information across a
wide range of intensity levels (right panels in
Fig. \ref{fig:May2003}).  Suppression of spectral troughs in the
rate-place representation of \ChT and \ChS units is greater than the
suppression in \LSR \ANFs at high \SPL.  Spectral enhancement in \TS
cells cannot be attributed to lateral suppression in the auditory
nerve alone; it requires some form of lateral inhibitory mechanism
that can perform spectral enhancement by suppression of noise between
peaks.

Lateral inhibition in varying strengths is found in the responses of
most cell types in all divisions of the cochlear nucleus
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,Young:1984,RhodeGreenberg:1994a}.  \ChT \TS
cells exhibit strong side-band inhibition and respond to vowels with a
clear and stable representation of acoustic spectrum in their average
firing rate at all stimulus levels
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,MayPrellEtAl:1998,RecioRhode:2000}.
Selective listening to low and high spontaneous rate \ANFs could be
one possible mechanism \citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987}.

\TS cells do receive inhibitory inputs
\citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} hence they
are candidates for operation of lateral inhibition.  Also, recurrent
excitation by \TS cells within the same frequency band could increase
the rate.

* Computational Models of the Cochlear Nucleus

# \todo[inline]{Needs more work on introduction of this section, vast amount of
# previous work, their faults, i.e.\ HOW my work fits in}



** Modelling of the Auditory Periphery

Computational models of cochlear nucleus neurons requires adequate representation of their inputs, \ANFs.
Models of the auditory periphery over the last 30 years have expanded our
understanding of the mechanical processes in the middle ear and cochlea,
and the specialised synapse between the inner hair cell and the auditory
nerve \citep{DavisVoigt:1991,Carney:1993,MeddisHewittEtAl:1990}. Modelling in the auditory periphery has
benefited extensively from the work of Liberman, Greenwood, Patterson,
Young, Sachs and others, in acoustic /in vivo/ experiments.

** Single neuron models of the chopper unit

A number of neural models of cochlear nucleus neurons have been
developed previously.  The basic approaches include point neuron
models
\citep{HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,ErikssonRobert:1999,PressnitzerMeddisEtAl:2001}
and conductance based compartmental models
\citep{BanksSachs:1991,WhiteYoungEtAl:1994,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,WangSachs:1995}. Recently,
a single compartment model with accurate membrane conductances was
developed based on whole cell recordings in \VCN neurons
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The mechanisms that contribute to the
electrical activity of stellate cells are the voltage-gated ionic
currents that give the cell its chopping behaviour.
\citet{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}
presented three new potassium current models from whole cell
recordings in the \VCN.  The significance of each membrane current in
the spiking behaviour of bushy and stellate cells is explored in their
single-compartment modelling study \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.


# FROM ROTHMAN 2003c Because little was known about the Naϩ and Kϩ currents in VCN
# stellate cells before 1991, Banks and Sachs used modified
# versions of the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) equations (1952),
# which included a fast Naϩ current (INa) and a high-threshold
# Kϩ current (IHT). Wang and Sachs (1995) presented a modified
# version of the Banks and Sachs stellate cell model where, to
# account for a higher spike threshold observed in vitro, the
# activation curves of INa and IHT were shifted 10 mV positive.
# Arle and Kim (1991) and Hewitt et al. (1992) presented
# “MacGregor-type” stellate cell models in which IHT was
# treated as a digital entity; that is, it was “on” during an action
# potential (AP) but “off” at other times. In general, the preced-
# ing HH-like and MacGregor-like stellate models were success-
# ful in that they replicated many of the response characteristics
# of stellate cells in vitro and in vivo. For example, during a
# depolarizing current pulse, the models exhibited repetitive fir-
# ing (i.e. a Type I current-clamp response) and when stimulated
# with auditory-nerve-like synaptic input, the models exhibit a
# “chopping” response in their poststimulus time histograms
# (PSTHs), reflecting their regular discharge. These models were
# also successful in replicating responses to more complex stim-
# uli (Arle and Kim 1991; Hewitt et al. 1992; Wang and Sachs
# 1995).


These models have been used to explore some basic responses of
stellate cells seen physiologically, for example:
- Simple regular chopping behaviour
\citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994,ArleKim:1991,HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,BanksSachs:1991}
- Adaptive chopping behaviour due to inhibition
\citep{WangSachs:1995,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994}
- Enhancement of dynamic range relative to \ANFs using combinations of
\HSR and \LSR fibres \citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,ErikssonRobert:1999}
- Effects of lateral inhibition
\citep{Shamma:1985,ErikssonRobert:1999,PressnitzerMeddisEtAl:2001}
- Synchronisation to envelope
\citep{HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,GhoshalKimEtAl:1992,WangSachs:1995}


\yellownote{Paragraph on Rothman and Manis Current Models in VCN Bushy
and Stellate Cells}

Present a robust model of \VCN neurons based on previous experimental
studies.
  - Replicates current clamp responses: type I of stellate cells and
type II of bushy cells
  - Replicates simple \PSTH responses solely based on sub- or
supra-threshold excitation at the soma
  - Replicates Phase locking capabilities of neurons (simulated steady
state input)
  - Derived from a complete characterisation of K+ currents rather
than ad hoc assumptions: hence more accurate.  The greatest difference
between the previous models is voltage dependent \IKHT and \IKLT
currents.
  - \IKA has a role in modulating the rate of repetitive firing.
Increasing \gKA counteracted depolarising effects of EPSPs, thereby
increasing threshold for \AP.  Effects of inhibition on \TS cells
could be to reset \IKA
  - \IKLT plays a role in type II by reducing input resistance hence
reducing the membrane time constant.  In intermediate type I-i cells
small amount of \IKLT had a greater affect on rate of firing than
\IKA. Small \IKLT could also benefit neurons by reducing EPSPs near
the axon hillock and reducing \AP back propagation in proximal
dendrites.
  - Modulation of \IKLT: Coincidence detection neurons would benefit
from \IKLT up-regulation to reduce membrane time constant, reduce EPSP
height and width.  Enhanced temporal acuity at onset, reduced firing
during sustained period, reduced spontaneous activity, reduction in
refractory period that leads to faster firing rates.  Increasing \IKLT
drops Vrev, hence Ih must be used to counterbalance \IKLT.

** Microcircuit Models in the Cochlear Nucleus

The first network models of the cochlear nucleus were in the \DCN
\citep{DavisVoigt:1991,ArleKim:1990,ArleKim:1991a,Arle:1992}.  The
cerebellar-like circuitry of the \DCN and its complex \EIRA cell type
behaviours were modelled by Blum and colleagues
\citep{BlumReed:2000,BlumReed:1998,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1995}
and in greater detail by Davis and colleagues
\citep{DavisVoigt:1996,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:2001}.

The role of \DS cell inhibition in the \DCN circuitry, particularly on
\TV cells \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}, is fundamentally important to
the \VCN stellate microcircuit.  Strong, fast wide-band inhibition of
\TV cells, induces non-linear rate-level response to tones and minimal
response to noise.  Topological properties of the \DS to \TV
connectivity has been explored even further, with suggestions of an
offset of the \DS connections from high \CF to low \CF frequency bands
\citep{ReissYoung:2005,LomakinDavis:2008,YoungDavis:2002}

# Network models of the \DCN that also include \VCN \DS cell inputs.

Table \ref{tab:ModellingCNTable} gives a summary of neural network of
the \VCN with emphasis on the output of \TS cells.  The existing
studies investigating \TS cells with local interneurons have not
utilised the important membrane cell properties of \TS cells, limited
by outdated input models, or contain errors in their network
connectivity.

# did not include recurrent \TS connections or
#GABAergic inhibition.

Selective processing of different \ANF inputs using some form of
inhibition was the first step toward including interneurons in a \TS
cell model
\citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994a,WangSachs:1995}.
\citet{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994a} used the ball and stick Hodgkin-Huxley
conductance neural model based on \citet{BanksSachs:1991}.  The
mechanism of selective processing removes the saturation of \HSR
fibres via shunting inhibition at synapses more proximal to the soma.
Their model enhanced the dynamic range of the \TS cell model to tones
and highlighted the need for inhibitory interneurons in \VCN models.

Lateral inhibition has been a strong feature in most \VCN network
models.  \citet{Shamma:1985} first proposed lateral inhibition in the
auditory pathway as a means of enhancing rate-place processing, and
led to biologically-inspired automatic speech recognition models
\citep{Shamma:1998,XuZhouEtAl:2011,WesargBrucknerEtAl:1996}.
#The only model to consider a network with \TV and \DS
#cells in a \VCN chopper model was \citet{ErikssonRobert:1999}.
\citet{ErikssonRobert:1999} was the first \VCN stellate network model
to include topographically connected \TV and \DS cells.  The
\citet{ErikssonRobert:1999} model included their own AN input model
\citep{RobertEriksson:1999}, a simplified version of existing
phenomenologically based ANF models
\citep{ZhangHeinzEtAl:2001,ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.


The network model by Bahmer and Langner
\citep{BahmerLangner:2006,BahmerLangner:2006a} proposed a new \VCN
network design, with an excitatory onset unit contacting recurrently
connected \TS cells.  The purpose of this model was to show that
recurrently connected \TS cells, with synaptic delay of 0.4 ms, form
the basis best modulation frequency peaks in the \IC.  The excitatory
onset unit that forms synapses with \TS cells is presumably octopus
cells.  Octopus cells do not have axonal collaterals in the \VCN
\citep{Adams:1997,CantBenson:2003}, hence the inclusion of Octopus
cell in a network of the \VCN is unsubstantiated. Despite using the
most up-to-date currents in the Onset neural model
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}, they failed to include the \Ih current, a
unique characteristic of Octupus cells \cite{CaiMcGeeEtAl:2000}.  The
\citet{BahmerLangner:2006a} model included an out of date AN input
model.


Recurrent excitation between \TS cells have been observed in mice
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} and has been investigated in two
modelling studies
\citep{BahmerLangner:2006,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}. Neither study
represents a realistic implementation of the stellate microcircuit.
In a speculative model, \citet{WiegrebeMeddis:2004} included a range
of \TS cells in each frequency band, each with a different intrinsic
firing rate.  The goal of their model was in decoding in \AM
properties in the \IC.  Unfortunately, the range \TS cells' intrinsic
firing rate of the model exceeded physiological observed rates.  Their
\AN model was also outdated and they used an unsubstantiated use of
recurrent \TS cells in the network.  \citet{BahmerLangner:2006} used
excitatory onset units to regulate the recurrent \TS cells,
unfortunately the only excitatory onset units in the cochlear nucleus
are octopus cells, which do not have axonal collaterals in the \VCN.
Recurrent networks in the cortex prefer inhibition for synchronisation
\citep{LyttonSejnowski:1991,BushSejnowski:1996}.  In theoretical
terms, inhibitory phasic input is significantly better than excitatory
phasic inputs at improving synchronisation in recurrent neural
networks \citep{VreeswijkAbbottEtAl:1995}.




* Objectives


The current state of neural network models fail to deliver at
producing a biophysically-realistic model of the cochlear nucleus,
specifically the microcircuit regulating the main output neurons, \TS
cells.

Realistic models of the cochlear nucleus are dependent on the performance and
realism of the input, the accuracy of the current models, and the assumptions
and reasonable measures used to obtain network parameters.  Phenomenological
models of the auditory nerve have advanced \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}
frequency decomposition, adaptation, offset recovery and replication of temporal
The membrane currents in \VCN neurons have already been investigated and
accurate models have been identified \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.

Advancement of
 - poor use of phenomenologically accurate AN models in existing CN
   models
 - lack of recent current models Rothman and Manis current models
 - lack of GABAergic neurons
 - incorrect use of known microcircuit surrounding \TS cells
 - Parameter optimisation typically hand tuned or not explained

*Goals*
 - biophysically realistic neural network model of the cochlear nucleus stellate
   microcircuit.
 - explore streamlined optimisation of all parameters in simplified CNSM using
   genetic algorithms
 - explore detailed, sequential optimisation of cochlear nucleus T-stellate
   microcircuit's parameters through simple responses
 - verification of optimised cochlear nucleus T-stellate microcircuit with \AM
   coding and vowel processing, with explicit analysis of \TS cells/choppers


**  Definition of the thesis hypotheses 

# from confirmation report

*** Hypothesis 1

Enhancement of the rate-place representation of spectral shape in \ChS
and \ChT units, relative to \ANFs, is owing to lateral inhibitory
mechanisms chopper units maintain a robust representation of stimulus
spectrum despite a reduction in spectral shape from auditory nerve
inputs \citep{PalmerShamma:2003}. Lateral inhibition from interneurons
in the cochlear nucleus mediates the spectral enhancement seen in the
rate-place representation of transiently chopping T stellate
cells. This mechanism implies that the rate-place representation of
complex stimuli will be significantly reduced if any sources of
inhibition are removed.


*** Hypothesis 2

Enhancement of the rate-place representation of spectral shape in \ChS
and \ChT units, relative to \ANFs, is due in part to recurrent
excitation by among \TS cells within the same frequency
band. Intracellular and morphological evidence suggests recurrent
excitation among \TS cells is likely to occur
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  Recurrent
excitation introduces considerable non-linearity to the network as
regions of high energy will elicit self-excitation.  This mechanism
could explain the steady response of \ChT cells despite a reduction in
sustained firing rate of \ANFs due to transient adaptation.


*** Hypothesis 3

Enhancement of the temporal representation of the fundamental
frequency of vowels in chopper units, relative to \ANFs, is due to
network mechanisms in the stellate microcircuit.  Synchronisation to
regular envelope fluctuations in T stellate cells, particularly \ChT
units, is enhanced relative to \ANFs
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  Enhanced
synchronisation to the fundamental frequency of vowels in \TS cells
could be used to segregate concurrent signals
\citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.  Tonic inhibition from GABAergic
sources and precise onset inhibition from glycinergic sources are
critical mechanisms that allow \TS cells to accurately respond to
pulsatile stimuli, such as the f0 of vowels.

# *** Hypothesis 4 Lateral inhibition in the \TS network is responsible for
# setting the upper limits of psychophysical simultaneous and forward masking
# \TS cells convey important spectral information to higher auditory centres and
# are the first to process across-spectral information in the auditory
# pathway. Forward masking in \TS cells has been shown to be comparable to the
# limits of psycho-physical perception
# \citep{BoettcherSalviEtAl:1990,Shore:1995} and is heavily influenced by
# inhibition \citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997,Shore:1998}.  Lateral suppression
# reduces the firing rate of \TS cells
# \citep{BlackburnSachs:1992,RhodeGreenberg:1994a} indicating a spread of
# masking to high and low frequency areas similar to the spreading function and
# offset of \citet{Johnston:1988}.  I concede that there are significant masking
# effects performed by other nuclei in the auditory pathway but these only add
# to the masking performed in the cochlear nucleus. This hypothesis suggests the
# upper limits of auditory detection for across-spectral and temporal masking is
# due primarily to lateral inhibition in the stellate network.
