\subsubsection{Afferent input}

In rats, the sole excitatory afferent input to tuberculoventral cells comes from the auditory nerve \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.


\citep{RubioJuiz:2004}
% In the DL 517 synaptic profiles were sampled. Synap-
% tic endings immunoreactive for glutamate were ϳ30% (n ϭ
% 168) of the total computed in this layer (Fig. 7B). The four
% subtypes of GLU-synaptic endings were observed and the
% GLU1 (n ϭ 81) was 3-fold more abundant than GLU4 (n ϭ
% 51), GLU2 (n ϭ 16), and GLU3 (n ϭ 20). Synaptic profiles
% immunoreactive for glycine and GABA represented 17% (n ϭ
% 88) of the total (Fig. 7B), and the GLY/GABA1 subtype (n ϭ
% 69) was three times more abundant than GLY/GABA2 (n ϭ
% 19). Synaptic profiles immunoreactive for glycine were the
% most heavily represented in this layer (48% of the total
% 7B), and the GLY2 subtype (n ϭ 175) was almost 2.5-fold
% more abundant than GLY1 (n ϭ 71). GABA-synaptic end-
% ings were less numerous (n ϭ 15; Fig. 7B).


% Synaptic endings on vertical cells (VCs). VCs are
% the most abundant inhibitory interneuron in the DL of the
% DCN. Cell bodies were located in the DL and had an approx-
% imate size of 15 ␮m in diameter. The nucleus was indented
% and centered located in the cell body and was surrounded by
% rough endoplasmic reticulum. Usually, a dendritic tree was
% observed attached to the cell body towards the superficial or
% the deepest part of the DL. Dendrites analyzed had an ap-
% proximate diameter of 1.2–2.5 ␮m. Cell bodies and dendrites
% were observed only immunoreactive for glycine (data not
% shown). These inhibitory interneurons received six of the
% nine subtypes of synaptic endings described above (Fig. 8).
% GLU1 was the only subtype found immunoreactive for glu-
% tamate on vertical cells and was preferentially on dendrites.
% Both types of synaptic endings immunoreactive for glycine
% and GABA (GLY/GABA1 and GLY/GABA2) were observed
% and both preferentially distributed on the cell body. How-
% ever, GLY/GABA1 was almost 3-fold more abundant than
% GLY/GABA2. The two types of synaptic endings immunore-
% active for glycine were observed distributed on vertical cells.
% GLY1 was observed preferentially on the cell body. The
% GLY2 was almost 2-fold more abundant and was found both
% on the cell body and on dendrites. GABA endings, although
% rare, were observed on both cell bodies and dendrites.


% The observation of inhibitory syn-
% apses on DCN interneurons suggests the presence of dis-
% inhibitory circuits. Consistent with this idea, inhibitory
% postsynaptic potentials can be recorded from VCs and can
% be blocked with both strychnine and bicuculline (Davis
% and Young, 2000). Indirect evidence of inhibition onto VCs
% also comes from their lack of spontaneous activity despite
% the presence of short latency excitation following auditory
% nerve stimulation (Zhang and Oertel, 1994). The blockade
% of glycine and or GABA does not increase spontaneous
% rates in the cell (Davis and Young, 2000).

% source of inhibitory afferents onto VCs is unknown and
% may come from intrinsic and/or extrinsic sources (Fig. 11).
% It has been suggested that glycinergic D-stellate cells from
% the ventral cochlear nucleus contact VCs (Davis and
% Young, 2000). Connections among VCs as well as those
% between CWCs and VCs may also be present (Manis et al.,
% 1994; Smith and Rhode, 1999). Consistent with this idea,
% GLY/GABA terminals were observed on both VC and
% CWCs.

\subsubsection{DS to TV}
OC projections to the DCN have also been implicated in the wide-band glycin-
ergic inhibition demonstrated physiologically in DCN
principal cells, as well as in the cells designated type II or
vertical (Caspary et al., 1987; Young et al., 1992; Nelken
and Young, 1994; Backoff et al., 1997; Joris and Smith,
1998; Spirou et al., 1999; Davis and Young, 2000; Ander-
son and Young, 2004). Our electron microscopy of OC
terminals in the deep DCN shows that they can synapse
on cell bodies or dendrites in this region, which is consis-
tent with a potential inﬂuence of the OCs on these cell
types.

\subsection{Acoustic Response of Tuberculoventral cells}


\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}
% Responses of tuberculoventral neurons to sound
% Taken together, recordings in vivo indicate that tubercu-
% loventral cells probably have type II characteristics
% and respond with “onset” or “chopper”
% temporal response patterns. Units with type II responses are sharply tuned, they
% have thresholds - 10 dB higher than other units with which
% they are intermingled, and they do not respond to broad-
% band noise (Voigt and Young 1980, 1990; Young 1980;
% Young and Brownell 1976). Young and his colleagues have
% shown that most neurons in the deep DCN respond to
% sound with either of two major types of response maps, type
% II or type IV (Evans and Nelson 1973; Shofner and Young
% 1985; Voigt and Young 1980, 1990; Young 1980; Young
% and Brownell 1976). Type III units may represent a sepa-
% rate population of cells, although their distinction
% from type II units is not absolutely clear (Young and Voigt
% 1982). Units with type IV responses can be subdivided into
% those that do and those that do not have well-defined
% borders of a central inhibitory
% area (Spirou and Young 1991). The question how response maps and anatomic
% types are correlated has not been completely resolved.
% Many neurons in the DCN that could be driven electrically
% from the VCN had response maps of type II (Young 1980).
% Of 29 type II units tested, 6, or - l/5, could be driven antidro-
% mically from the VCN; of 7 type II units tested 1, or l/7,
% could be driven from the dorsal acoustic stria. Therefore
% some, but not necessarily all, type II units are tuberculoven-
% tral cells. Type II units have variable temporal firing pat-
% terns, “pauser,” “chopper,” or “onset/sustained,”
% and have firing rates that are nonmonotonic
% functions of intensity ( Shofner and Young 1985 ) . Rhode and his colleagues,
% too, find variable temporal firing patterns in the deep layers
% of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. They suggest that “onset/
% graded” responses come from type II units (Rhode and
% Greenberg 1992). Onset / sustained ( Shofner and Young
% 19 8 5 ) and onset / graded peristimulus
% time histograms (Rhode and Greenberg 1992) are similar in that these units
% have a high probability of firing at the beginning of a tone at
% the best frequency and that the probability of firing drops
% off after the beginning of the tone.
