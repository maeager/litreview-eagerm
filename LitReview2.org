\todo[inline]{The "SO WHAT" of the thesis - Lit review needs to identify the
weaknesses in the literature - need to give a CRITICAL rather than just
descriptive overview of the field.  It is best to put this right at the start!}

\todo[inline]{There are parts of this chapter that I would describe as
descriptive rather than critical.  I would like to point out the 'Synaptic
Organisation in the Stellate Microcircuit' section is completely descriptive and
may be reproduced in other parts of the chapter. Should this be a separate
chapter or an appendix?}


The development of biophysically-realistic neural network models is a major
objective of computational neuroscience.  Recent advances in the field have
meant that this goal is now more achievable than it has ever been before.  In
the auditory system, the high fidelity of acoustic information mean synaptic
interactions on the millisecond scale are needed to modulate activity to enhance
the representation of the stimulus spectrum and temporal periodicities. In the
\CN, the first processing stage in the auditory brainstem, histological and
pharmacological labelling techniques have produced a flood of information about
the anatomy, physiology, immunohistochemistry, pharmacology and intrinsic
membrane properties of the different cell types.
The synaptic organisation of cells in the cochlear nucleus has been
examined in detail in various species (cat:
\citealt{Cant:1981,TolbertMorest:1982,SaintMorestEtAl:1989}, mice:
\citealt{WickesbergOertel:1988,WickesbergOertel:1990,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991},
guinea pigs: \citealt{JuizHelfertEtAl:1996a,OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}, rats:
VCN\space \citealt{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003,RubioJuiz:2004}).
Physiological studies combined with labelling have given greater certainty to
correlations between physiological response types and morphological cell types
\citep[e.g.,~][]{SmithRhode:1989,OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.
Intracellular recordings have ascertained the electrical properties and the
different synaptic inputs of \TS, \DS and \TV cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}.  Descriptions of current
dynamics for synaptic receptors \citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999,HartyManis:1998}
and membrane channels \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a} specific to
the \VCN enable accurate mathematical models to be developed at the cell and
synaptic level.  With this information a realistic biological model of the
stellate network is attainable and can provide further insight into processing
of acoustic information.

\Gls{TS} cells of the \VCN encode a robust representation of the stimulus
spectrum in their average rate and a temporal representation essential for
speech \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}. They project directly to the inferior
colliculus, and are therefore important in conveying information to higher
auditory centres. \TS cells are known to form a local microcircuit network with
neurons within its isofrequency lamina and across the frequency range of the
nucleus. The microcircuit includes \DS cells, a wide-band inhibitory cell in the
\VCN, \TV cells, a narrowband inhibitory cell in the \DCN, and Golgi cells, a
GABAergic neuron in the outer granule shell of the \CN
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}. Inhibition is known to
play a key role in shaping the average rate response, synchronisation to
modulation and onset delay of cells in the cochlear nucleus
\citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,EvansZhao:1998,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.



The intrinsic behaviour of T stellate cells are basically integrators, which
allows phasic input from \ANFs to be converted to a tonic or chopping output.
The tonic behaviour suits encoding of spectrum across population since encoding
the peaks and valleys is relatively independent of time after onset of sound;
and also suits encoding of envelope of sounds, which is important for speech
\citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  Presence of active membrane channels at rest
means that TS cells are sensitive to neuromodulatory currents
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,FujinoOertel:2001,RothmanManis:2003} and
increases its response time to temporally important features like vowel
transitions and glottal pulses
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004,ClareyPaoliniEtAl:2004}.  The average discharge
rate of the two chopper populations provide either a ‘high contrast’
representation independent of level (\ChS) or a level dependent, ‘low contrast’
representation of stimulus spectrum (\ChT) \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003}.
The temporal coding of cells in the cochlear nucleus has also been studied
extensively with AM tones
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,RhodeGreenberg:1994}, and
ripple noise \citep{WinterPalmerEtAl:1993}; however, it was
\citet{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997} who went further in showing that chopper cells
provide a periodicity-tagged spectral representation that can be used to
separate simultaneously presented vowels.


The fundamental rhetorical question in the literature comes down to whether
intrinsic membrane mechanisms or network and synaptic mechanisms are more
important for the behaviour of T stellate cells \citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.
Other important questions may need to be addressed first :
# sustained firing despite AN adaptation
# tonic suits encoding of spectrum across population since encoding the peaks and valleys is relatively independent of time after onset of sound
# suits encong of envelope of sounds, important for speech
# Onset: Volley of Excitation + feedforward excitation + DS inhibition 
#      - After onset: Phasic excitation + feedforward excitation + NMDA activation + TV inhibition (+ small DS inhibition) + GABA inhibition = stable excitation but loss of temporal features
# sensitive to neuromodulatory currents
# Mechanisms of Tonic Firing Obscure Temporal Features
# intrinsic membrane mechanisms versus network and synaptic mechanisms
What mechanisms in T stellate cells are essential for sustained firing to constant sound level despite significant adaptation in \ANF input?
How are the different categories of \ANFs (\LSR and \HSR) processed by T stellate cell microcircuit?
Is the loss of temporal information at high frequencies due to intrinsic properties or tonic inhibition and to what extent does this influence higher auditory systems?
What is the functional difference between the heterogeneous T stellate cell population (i.e., \ChT and \ChS units)?
What is the purpose of the polysynaptic recurrent inhibition between Golgi, DS and TV cells, and what is their direct influence on T stellate cells?  
What are the effects of asymmetric or non-Gaussian topographic connections across isofrequency laminae and how does this effect the spectral representation across the population of T stellate cells?
The purpose of developing the network surrounding T stellate cells is to answer these questions.
#generalise and abstract the features of the network that make it unique.



# Why do DS cell connections to TV cells project to slightly higher \CFs?  
# , across frequencies and within frequencies in temporal
# and rate based measures?









\todo[inline]{ I am still not sure whether the next four paragraphs belong here
or at the end of the Lit review / Introduction Chapter.}


# The final hypothesis addresses the psycho-physical relevance of the components
# in the network.  Across-spectral processing within the cochlear nucleus
# stellate network produces lateral and temporal suppression.

# Recordings form cochlear implant stimulated auditory nerve fibres can possibly
# be used as inputs to the model to determine the responses within the cochlear
# nucleus.



This doctoral thesis is aimed at investigating the important physiological
mechanisms involved in the processing of sounds, specifically spectral and
temporal enhancement, in the cochlear nucleus of mammals.  Computer modelling
enhances our knowledge of complex neural interactions in \TS cells and
provides further understanding of inputs to higher centres.  The cochlear
nucleus stellate network contains many independent simple components that are
combined in non-linear feedback and feed-forward processes.  Intuition and
simple calculation cannot serve to predict the response of such a complex
system, therefore a more complex model must be used.  A biological neural
network that contains a high degree of realism at the individual cell level may
contribute to our knowledge of synaptic organisation in producing physiological
behaviour.  The complexity of synaptic organisation is compounded by
inter-species and within-species variation in computer models. Variation is
managed by constraining the parameters to a range of values to elicit
physiological behaviour observed in vivo.

The implications of lateral inhibition and recurrent excitation on signal
processing by T stellate cells are two fold: enhanced spectral representation
and enhanced synchronisation to the fundamental frequency.  The physiological
and signal processing significance of particular components in the network are
addressed in the three hypotheses of this thesis.  Rate-place representation of
vowel spectrum are analysed for the effects of lateral inhibition and recurrent
excitation.  Spectral shape enhancement is important for a stable representation
of stimulus spectrum to be conveyed to higher auditory centres. Clarifying the
roles of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition contributes to the understanding
of spectral and temporal influences of inhibitory circuits in the cochlear
nucleus.

Higher processing stages in the auditory system also perform advanced auditory
processing, to whatever extent it is limited by the information contained at the
bottleneck of the auditory nerve.  Therefore, signal processing done by lateral
inhibition and recurrent excitation in the cochlear nucleus has a significant
influence on perception at higher levels of auditory processing.  Understanding
the complex processing done by the cochlear nucleus may also contribute to
understanding the limitations of hearing-impairment devices.  Further
understanding how the processing of sound in noisy environments works within the
network could aid in developing new sound processing strategies for the cochlear
implant and hearing aids.


* Auditory System and Processing


Speech is a unique and fundamental tool in communication between humans.  We
continually deal with various distortions of the acoustic environment (e.g.,
background noise and reverberation) to extract information from signals entering
the ear.  Vowels provide a salient feature of speech that is spectrally and
temporally distinct from other natural sounds.  The spectrum of each vowel is
distinguished by the location of high energy spectral peaks called
formants. Robust representation of spectrum at different intensities is
important for speech and other auditory communication \citep{YoungOertel:2004}.
The main tasks of the auditory system are to (1) separate out individual
frequency components of sound; (2) enhance spectral and temporal contrasts to improve meaningful \SNR; and (3) extract behavioural frequency
cues \citep{Evans:1992}.
\todo[inline]{ FIX Sentence (check Evans)} 

Rough frequency decomposition is performed by the basilar membrane and organ of
Corti in the mammalian cochlea, which transforms mechanical signals to neural
signals in the \ANFs.  The next element of the auditory process occurs in the
cochlear nucleus, the first processing stage of the central auditory pathway in
which all \ANFs end. Enhancing spectral and temporal contrasts requires
sophisticated parallel processing strategies involving networks of neurons with
feed-forward and feed-back connections.


** Peripheral Auditory System

\todo[inline]{Intro to section on peripheral AN}
# \citep{EvansNelson:1973,SpirouYoung:1991,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungNelkenEtAl:1993,ArleKim:1991a}


** Auditory Nerve Fibres

\todo[inline]{Small and concise lit review of ANFs}

*** Spontaneous discharge rate (SR)

\todo[inline]{More work on references here} 
The mammalian auditory nerve forms a
bimodal distribution where 30--40\% of the fibres have SR $<$ 10 spikes/s and
60--70\% have SR $>$ 30 spikes/s (Refs) . Threshold is correlated to the amount
of spontaneous spike activity (SR) that occurs in the absence of
experimenter-controlled stimulation. \LSR fibres have relatively high
thresholds, whereas \HSR fibres have low thresholds. Across the audible
frequency range, fibres of similar \CFs can vary in SR from near 0 to $>$ 100
spikes/s.  The bimodal SR distribution is present across the entire audible
frequency range for the animal (Refs here), and implies a general organisational
principle for the mammalian auditory nerve. Fibres of the different SR groupings
exhibit distinct physiologic features, especially in terms of their contribution
to the dynamic range of hearing (Refs here) and representation of speech sounds
(Refs here). The collective evidence suggests that different SR groupings of
auditory nerve fibres serve separate roles in acoustic information
processing. It might be that the \HSR fibres with their low thresholds prefer
to function in quiet, whereas \LSR fibres with their high thresholds operate
better in loud and noisy environments.

*** TODO Projection to the Cochlear Nucleus


\todo[inline]{See  \citep{RyugoParks:2003} for review}

# Upon passing the Schwann-glia border (marking entrance
# into the central nervous system), individual auditory nerve
# fibres penetrate a variable distance into the nucleus, de-
# pending upon fibre CF, and bifurcate into an ascending
# branch and a descending branch. The ascending branch has a
# relatively straight trajectory into the AVCN and terminates
# as a large, axosomatic ending called the endbulb of Held.
# The descending branch likewise has a straight trajectory
# through the PVCN before entering the DCN. Along the
# way, these main branches give rise to short collaterals. The
# collaterals ramify further and exhibit en passant swellings
# and terminal boutons. Fibers of similar CFs disperse to
# form a 3-dimensional sheet running through the nucleus,
# and stacks of these sheets represent the isofrequency con-
# tours of the nucleus (Fig. 9, bottom). The sheets have a
# horizontal orientation within the ventral cochlear nucleus
# but twist caudally to form parasagittal sheets in the DCN.
# These projections underlie the tonotopic organization of
# the resident neurons of the cochlear nucleus [19,160,191].


# 5. Structure-function correlates
# 5.1. SR and peripheral correlates
# Morphologic specializations have been found in the in-
# nervation pattern of inner hair cells with respect to SR fibre
# groupings. High-SR fibres (>18 spikes/s) have thick periph-
# eral processes that tend to contact the “pillar” side of the
# inner hair cell, whereas low-SR fibres (<18 spikes/s) have
# thin peripheral processes that tend to contact the modiolar
# side of the hair cell [98,111]. Furthermore, there is SR
# segregation within the spiral ganglion. Low-SR neurons
# tend to be distributed on the side of the scala vestibuli,
# whereas high-SR fibres can be found throughout the gan-
# glion [82,100]. These peripheral differences are maintained
# by the pattern of central projections, and embedded within
# the tonotopic organization.
# 5.2. SR and central correlates
# There are morphologic correlates that correspond to
# groupings of fibres with respect to SR. Compared to fibres
# of high SR (>18 spikes/s), fibres of low SR (<18 spikes/s)
# exhibit different innervation characteristics with the IHCs
# [99,111], give rise to greater collateral branching in the
# AVCN [51], emit collaterals that preferentially innervate
# the small cell cap [100,177], and manifest striking special-
# izations in the large axosomatic endings, the endbulbs of
# Held [185] and their synapses [178].
# The typical high-SR fibre traverses the nucleus and gives
# rise to short collaterals that branch a few times before
# terminating (Fig. 10A). There was a suggestion that projec-
# tions of the different SR groups might be segregated along
# a medial-lateral axis within the core of the AVCN [94] but
# single-unit labelling studies do not unambiguously support or
# refute this proposal [51,82,100,208]. There are usually one
# or two terminal endbulbs at the anterior tip of the ascending
# branch, and the remaining terminals appear as en passant
# swellings or terminal boutons. It is presumed that these
# swellings are sites of synaptic interactions with other neu-
# ronal elements in the cochlear nucleus. Approximately 95#
# of all terminal endings were small and round, definable as
# “bouton-like” [163]. The remaining endings were modified
# endbulbs that tended to contact the somata of globular bushy
# cells and large endbulbs of Held that contacted the somata
# of spherical bushy cells. In contrast to birds, low-frequency
# myelinated auditory nerve fibres in mammals give rise
# to endbulbs. Furthermore, the endbulbs of low-frequency
# fibres tend to be the largest of the entire population of
# fibres.

# There is a clear SR-related difference in axonal branch-
# ing and the number of endings. Low-SR fibres give rise to
# greater collateral branching in the AVCN compared to that
# of high-SR fibres [51,100,101,208]. In cats, the ascending
# branch of low-SR fibres give rise to longer collaterals, twice
# as many branches (there are approximately 50 branches per
# low-SR fibre compared to 25 per high-SR fibre), and twice as
# many bouton endings (Fig. 10B). These endings, while more
# numerous, are also smaller compared to those of high-SR
# fibres [163]. The greater total collateral length is illustrated
# by low-SR fibres that have an average of 5 mm of collaterals
# per ascending branch compared to 2.8 mm of collaterals per
# high-SR fibre [51]. The inference from these observations is
# that low-SR fibres contact more neurons distributed over a
# wider region of the cochlear nucleus than do high-SR fibres.
# If the perception of loudness is proportional to the num-
# ber of active neurons [195], then this branching differential
# may provide the substrate. The activation of high-threshold,
# low-SR fibres by loud sounds would not only increase the
# pool of active auditory nerve fibres but also produce a spread
# of activity throughout the AVCN. This recruitment would
# be useful because the discharge rate of high-SR fibres is al-
# ready saturated at moderate sound levels.
# There is no systematic difference in the average number
# of terminals generated by the descending branch with re-
# spect to fibre SR. Low-SR fibres do, however, have a wider
# distribution across the frequency axis in the DCN as com-
# pared to high-SR fibres [171]. The endings lie within the
# deep layers of the DCN, below the pyramidal cell layer, and
# terminate primarily within the neuropil. The average termi-
# nal field width for low-SR fibres is 230.5 ± 73 ␮m, whereas
# that for high-SR fibres is 87.2 ± 41 ␮m. The significance of
# terminal arborization differences between high- and low-SR
# fibres might be involved in details of isofrequency laminae.
# The relatively short and narrow arborization of high-SR,
# low-threshold fibres could occupy the center of the lamina
# and endow those neurons with lower thresholds and sharper
# tuning. In contrast, the longer and broader terminal field of
# low-SR fibres could preferentially innervate the “edges” of
# the lamina. This kind of organization might establish a func-
# tional segregation of units having distinct physiological fea-
# tures within an isofrequency lamina, as has been proposed in
# the inferior colliculus [161] and auditory cortex [184,186].






* Cochlear Nucleus

The cochlear nucleus receives the primary ascending input from \ANFs and
contains a heterogeneous population of cell types.  Cell types have been
classified using criteria including morphology, immunohistochemistry, synaptic
organisation, response to acoustic stimuli and frequency tuning
\citep[see~reviews][]{RyugoParks:2003,CantBenson:2003,YoungOertel:2004}.  The
two major divisions are the \VCN and \DCN\@.  The different projections out of
the nucleus reflect the highly specialised parallel processing that is performed
to extract particular acoustic information contained in the auditory nerve.  The
\DCN in mammals generally has a cerebellar-like laminar structure with many
interneurons, whereas the \VCN consists of a magnocellular core and a marginal
shell (otherwise called the \GCD in rodents).  The marginal shell is thought to
be involved in regulating the gain in the magnocellular core from inputs outside the \CN
\citep{EvansZhao:1993,GhoshalKim:1997}.

Recent reviews of characterised cells have examined the association between the
corresponding projection characteristics and physiological acoustic
characteristics
\citep{CantBenson:2003,RyugoParks:2003,SmithMassieEtAl:2005,YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.
\citet{DoucetRyugo:2006} showed the limited number of \VCN multipolar neuron
studies that have performed physiological unit assessments as well as
classification of morphology via labelling. The \PSTH response to short tone
bursts was used to classified \CN neurons into primary-like, chopper, or onset
chopper
\citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1963,SmithJorisEtAl:1993,ShofnerYoung:1985,YoungRobertEtAl:1988,BlackburnSachs:1989}.


The afferent and intrinsic synaptic connectivity in the cochlear nucleus have
also shown wide interest in the literature
\citep[see~reviews][]{YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  The network in
Figure \ref{fig:CNschematic} shows the connections, regarded in the literature
with sufficient evidence, among cochlear nucleus that are involved in modulating
\TS cells.  The cells and their synaptic interaction will be discussed in the
following sections and will form the basis of investigation for this thesis.

#** Cell Types


** TODO T Stellate Cells

\glsreset{TS} \TS cells lie in the core region of the \VCN, primarily in the
posteroventral section (\PVCN) with some in the posterior part of the
anteroventral section (\AVCN)
\citep{Osen:1969,Lorente:1981,BrawerMorestEtAl:1974,OertelWuEtAl:1990,DoucetRyugo:2006,DoucetRyugo:1997}.
\TS cells encode complex features of the stimulus that are important for the
recognition of natural sounds and are a major source of excitatory input to the
inferior colliculus \citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.


# distinction between TS and DS cells is made by their axonal projections,
# dendritic projections, and their immunohistochemistry.


This section gives a brief description of TS cells (and distinction between DS
cells) including cell morphology, immuno-histochemistry, intrinsic membrane
properties, and synaptic contacts. The determination of how theses elements
contribute to the heterogeneous acoustic behaviour in different chopper subtypes is still to be discovered. 


*** Morphology of T Stellate Cells

Histology staining of the cochlear nucleus began almost a century ago
\citep{Lorente:1933}, and the role of classification and naming of distinct cell
types began. Star-like cell bodies observed with Golgi impregnation were called
\textit{stellate} cells \citep{Osen:1969}. Nissl staining showed the multiple
dendritic morphology of \TS and \DS cells, hence the name \textit{multipolar}
was adopted \citep{BrawerMorestEtAl:1974,Lorente:1981}. Multipolar cells were
also divided into two groups, disperse or clumped Nissl, according to their
cytoplasmic appearance in thionin-stained sections
\citep{Liberman:1991,Liberman:1993}.  Further nomenclature
based on dendritic differences into planar (TS cells) and radial (DS cells) has
also been suggested in rats \citep{DoucetRyugo:1997,DoucetRyugo:2006}.

Distinction based on somatic innervation in multipolar neurons separated them
into two types: type I (few somatic) and type II (many somatic and dendritic)
\citep{Cant:1981}.  The axonal projections of DS cells' axons head dorsally
toward the \DCN via the dorsal acoustic stria (hence D in D stellate), while \TS
cells leave the \CN ventrally through the ventral acoustic stria or trapezoid
body (hence T) \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990}. Some \DS cells are also commissural,
exiting the CN via the dorsal acoustic stria and cross the midline to terminate
in the contralateral \CN \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,NeedhamPaolini:2007,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}.  
# distinction between TS and DS cells is made by their axonal projections,
# dendritic projections, and their immunohistochemistry.


\todo[inline]{For consistency, the TS cell modelled in this thesis represents each of the
 various names given to neurons with similar characteristics (T stellate, type
 1 multipolar, planar, and chopper PSTH units) in different animals, with
 closest association with rodents and cats. The DS cell type includes all those
 previously named as D stellate, type 2 multipolar, radial, and OnC
 PSTH unit.}

*** TODO Acoustic Response of T Stellate Cells

TS cells receive a narrow frequency band of \ANF inputs and have a chopping
response to \CF tone bursts \citep{SmithRhode:1989,BlackburnSachs:1989}.  Few
synaptic terminals contact on their soma; the majority of inputs contact the
proximal dendrites \citep{Cant:1981}. TS cells are the primary excitatory output
to the inferior colliculus \citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.

The response to acoustic stimulation is measured from a \PSTH
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989}.  The level of tuning and suppression
of neurons receptive field is examined using the \EIRA method
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,SpirouYoung:1991,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungNelkenEtAl:1993,ArleKim:1991a}.

The regular-firing chopping pattern shown in Figure \ref{fig:chopping} is
characteristic of TS cells. \ChS and \ChT are differentiated by the regularity
of discharge throughout the stimulus using the \CV statistic
\citep{YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  Recurrent excitation among \TS cells of similar
\CFs was first suggested by \citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The small
numbers of axonal collaterals are confined to the same frequency band as their
dendrites, indicating recurrent connections are between cells encoding a similar
frequency \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  This could
compensate for rapid transient adaptation in auditory nerve excitation, allowing
a robust representation of the spectral energy falling within the cell's
response area to be transmitted to higher centres.

# CantBenson
# The type I multipolar cells are narrowly tuned and respond to tone bursts with
# regular trains of action potentials, a response referred to as a
# {\textquotedblleft}chopper{\textquotedblright} pattern (e.g.,
# [168,220]). Neurons that exhibit chopper responses can differ substantially in
# their dendritic morphology ([58,179,194],cf. [30]) which suggests that a further
# subdivision of this class of neurons may be possible. In mouse, the equivalent
# cells (T-stellate cells) appear to integrate input from the auditory nerve with
# that from other multipolar cells of both types

# [61]. In general, the response properties of chopper units suggest that they
# play an important role in encoding complex acoustic stimuli, perhaps including
# speech sounds (e.g., [26,131,180]).

# The projection pattern of type I multipolar cells is illustrated in Fig.
# 2F. The axons leave the cochlear nucleus via the trapezoid body
# [55,151,220,245], where they make up the ventral thin fibre component
# [31,215,245,248]. Possibly because they are thinner than the axons of the other
# cell types, there have been few reports of successful intra-axonal injections of
# these fibres so it is not entirely clear whether the different projections arise
# from the same or different populations. Multipolar cells are a major source of
# input from the cochlear nucleus to the contralateral inferior colliculus
# [2,12,24,33,37,102,154,156,191,205]. It seems likely

# that most, if not all, type I multipolar cells participate in this projection
# [102]. The projection arises from neurons throughout the VCN, including all but
# the most anterior part of the AVCN and the octopus cell area in the PVCN. The
# same neurons that project to the inferior colliculus also send collateral
# branches to the DCN ([4],also, [55,61,167,217]). In both targets, the synaptic
# terminals contain round synaptic vesicles, compatible with an excitatory effect
# (IC: [154],DCN: [220]). The projections from the cochlear nucleus have been
# shown to directly contact neurons in the inferior colliculus that project to the
# medial geniculate nucleus [156]. A smaller projection to the ipsilateral
# inferior colliculus also arises from multipolar cells in the VCN
# (e.g., [2,154]). The axons that make up this projection travel in the lateral
# trapezoid body tract [245,248]. Multipolar cells in the VCN give rise to
# projections to

# the dorsomedial periolivary nucleus in cat [215] or superior paraolivary nucleus
# in rat and guinea pig [64,201], to the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body
# [64,215] and to the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus
# [64,91,206,215]. The cells that give rise to these projections are probably the
# type I multipolar cells [218]. Although it has not been established definitely,
# it seems likely that these projections arise from the same cells that project to
# the inferior colliculus. Multipolar cells of unknown type project to the
# ipsilateral

# lateral superior olivary nucleus and the lateral periolivary region in cats
# [41,233,248]. In addition to their projection to the DCN, the type I multipolar
# cells give rise to extensive collateral branches within the VCN
# [4,61,151,220,238]. These appear to play an important role in shaping late
# responses of cells in the VCN to auditory nerve stimulation

     - no LKT in TS, LKT makes bushy and octopus insensitive to steady currents
       \citep{OertelFujino:2001,McGinleyOertel:2006}
     - Ih higher in TS & activated more at lower potentials than in bushy and
       octopus, so that it is less active at rest
     - high resistance \rightarrow greater voltage changes in small modulating
       current \rightarrow Ih can be modulated by G-protein coupled receptors,
       hence making TS more excitable when Ih activated
       \citep{RodriguesOertel:2006}

**** Driving inputs

   - Proximal dendrites and at the soma:
     - \ANF provide glutamatergic excitation for T stellates
       \citep{Cant:1981,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,Alibardi:1998a}
        - only 5 or 6 in mice \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,CaoOertel:2010}
     - Recurrent excitation from other T stellate cells
       \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}

**** Intrinsic neuromodulation

***** Glycinergic DS and TV Cells

     - Glycine from DS cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}
     - Glycine from TV cells \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990,ZhangOertel:1993b}
       - complicated recurrent loop: TS excite TV cells is several intracellular

***** Recurrent local excitation between T stellate cells

# %% Needs correcting

Sources of polysynaptic excitation \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}, observed
with late \EPSPs observed in T stellate cells, indicate that T stellate cells
receive excitatory input from excitatory interneurons in the slices. When
separated from their natural synaptic inputs, isolated axons cannot contribute
to polysynaptic responses.  Monosynaptic responses have latencies between 0.5
(synaptic delay) and \sim 3 ms (2.5 ms conduction delay for an unmyelinated
fibre of 0.5 mm plus 0.5 ms synaptic delay). Therefore \EPSPs with latencies of
\sim 3 ms are polysynaptic and must be generated by excitatory interneurons
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Two other experimental observations confirm
this conclusion. As cut axons have not been observed to fire spontaneously, the
presence of spontaneous \EPSPs is an indication of the existence of excitatory
interneurons. Furthermore, the activation of \EPSPs with the application of
glutamate indicates that the dendrites of excitatory interneurons are accessible
from the bath.  TS cells are excitatory neurons known to terminate in the
vicinity of TS cells. TS cells terminate locally in the multipolar cell area of
the \PVCN \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. This area is occupied by \TS cells
and occasionally \DS and bushy cells, some or all of which are therefore
presumably their targets. The ultrastructure of \TS cell terminals and
functional studies of the inputs to the inferior colliculi is consistent with
their being excitatory (Oliver 1984, 1987; Smith and Rhode 1989).

**** TODO Extrinsic neuromodulation

***** Periolivary cells (GABA + GAD - glutamic acid decarboxylase)

     - observed in \PVCN close to TS\space \citep{AdamsMugnaini:1987}
     - (GABA + GAD - glutamic acid decarboxylase) markers, \GAD effectively
       Glycine \citep{GoldingOertel:1997}
     - can also arise from GABAergic neurons in ipsi \LNTB and DM Periolivary
  - These findings indicate that GABA inhibits these IC neurons for a brief
    period following the stimulus offset. The SPON was suggested as the probable
    source of this inhibition in the rat IC (Faingold 2002). However, whether
    this offset inhibition in the IC is affected by changes in stimulus duration
    and intensity remains unknown.



Superior periolivary nulcei (SPON) neurons projecting to the \VCN are immunoreactive to \GABA and \GAD
markers, which has been primarily observed by Juiz and Helfert and colleagues in
guinea pigs
\citep{JuizHelfertEtAl:1996,JuizHelfertEtAl:1996a,JuizAlbinEtAl:1994,JuizRubioEtAl:1993,ShoreHelfertEtAl:1991,HelfertBonneauEtAl:1989,JuizHelfertEtAl:1989}
and the connection has been confirmed in other animals (cats:
\citealt{Adams:1983,SpanglerCantEtAl:1987}, rat:
\citealt{CamposCaboEtAl:2001},guinea pigs:
\citealt{OstapoffMorestEtAl:1990,Schofield:1991,QiuWangEtAl:1995}). 
These are typically from ipsilateral SPON 
can also arise from GABAergic neurons in ipsilateral \LNTB and DM Periolivary


GAD markers were shown in terminals apposed to TS cells in PVCN \citep{AdamsMugnaini:1987}.
\GAD is effectively Glycine and generally co-localised with GABA in the VCN \citep{GoldingOertel:1997}.
Mixed Glycine/\GABA terminals on the soma and dendrites of T and D stellate cells, observed with
pleomorphic vesicles \citep{AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993,SmithRhode:1989}.  


\TS cells and monotonic small cells in the cap
surrounding the \VCN, send axonal collaterals to the periolivary nucleus
\citep{Schofield:1995,Schofield:2002} and excite Glycine and GABA labelled
neurons \citep{DehmelKopp-ScheinpflugEtAl:2002}. The periolivary nuclei,
including the mixed Gly/GABA-ergic neurons, are thought to play a role in sound
duration
\citep{DehmelKopp-ScheinpflugEtAl:2002,KadnerKuleszaEtAl:2006,KuleszaKadnerEtAl:2007}.

***** VNTB cells (ACh)

     - collateral branches of OCB go to \GCD
       \citep{MellottMottsEtAl:2011,SherriffHenderson:1994,OsenRoth:1969}
     - TS have nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors \citep{FujinoOertel:2001}
     - Synaptic input to the medial olivocochlear neurons Previous work has
       shown that OC neurons receive inputs from two subdivisions of the
       cochlear nucleus (Warr, 1969; Robertson and Winter, 1988; Thompson and
       Thompson, 1991a; Ye et al., 2000)
     - Two separate regions of the cochlear nucleus provide inputs: the PVCN
       (Warr, 1969; Thompson and Thompson, 1991a) and the AVCN shell (Ye et al.,
       2000). Ultrastructural work on labeled PVCN endings in the superior
       olivary complex has shown them to have round vesicles (Thompson and
       Thompson, 1991b), ruling out the PVCN as a source for our uncommon
       synapse type containing pleomorphic vesicles.


The olivocochlear bundle, the terminals of which contain high concentrations of
\AChE, sends collaterals to the CN with most terminals in the \GCD
\citep{MellottMottsEtAl:2011,SherriffHenderson:1994,OsenRoth:1969}.
The \AChE-positive terminals of this fibre bundle appear to be limited in their
distribution to the molecular granule and cell layers, where they aggregate into
glomeruli \citep{OsenRoth:1969}.  In rats, onset choppers are monosynaptically
excited by shocks to the \OCB
\citep{MuldersPaoliniEtAl:2003,MuldersWinterEtAl:2002,MuldersPaoliniEtAl:2009}.


The role of ACh neuromodulation in the stellate microcircuit is not fully
understood.  Excitatory ACh input to TS cells, together with \OCB effects on the
organ of Corti, could enhance spectral peaks in noise across the population of
chopper units \citep{FujinoOertel:2001,OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.

***** Noradrenaline  (NA) and Serotonin (5HT)

    - Raphe nuclei (5HT) and Locus coeruleus Peribrachial cells (NE)

    - both increase firing in T stellates \citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011} in
      presence of glut and gly blockers \to hence act on post synapse (TS cells)
    - both G-protein coupled, both act on either pre or post synaptic cells

*** Summary

#  FIX

As a population, T stellate cells encode the spectrum of sounds. They receive
acoustic input from the auditory nerve fibres. Several mechanisms contribute to
that transformation: Feed-forward excitation through other T stellate cells,
co-activation of excitation and inhibition, reduction in synaptic depression,
and the amplification of excitatory synaptic current over time through \NMDA
receptors. They deliver that information to nuclei that make use of spectral
information.  T stellate cells terminate in the \DCN, to olivocochlear efferent
neurons, to the lateral superior olive, and most importantly to the
contralateral inferior colliculus. These targets use spectral information to
localise sounds, to adjust the sensitivity of the inner ear, and to recognise
and understand sounds.


# Birds also process sounds through
# neurons that resemble T stellate cells in their projections and also
# in their cellular properties, attesting to the fundamental importance
# that T stellate-like cells have for hearing in vertebrates.

** D Stellate Cells

D stellate cells are wide-band inhibitory cells that have an \OnC \PSTH to tones
and have wide ranging effects in the \VCN, \DCN and collateral \CN
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,SmithMassieEtAl:2005,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  DS
cell axon terminals contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter, glycine, and they
synapse locally in the \VCN and \DCN and send a commissural projection to the
contralateral cochlear nucleus that mediates fast inhibition between the nuclei
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003}.  \DS cells sparse throughout the magnocellular core
of the \AVCN and \PVCN and they are outnumbered 15 to 1 in the cat against \TS
cells \citep{RyugoParks:2003}.  Electromicroscopic studies of DS neurons show
profuse synapses on their soma and proximal dendrites, with over 80\% \TAC
\citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989}.  \DS neurons usually have 3-4 main dendrites
extending perpendicular to the direction of auditory nerve fibres suggesting
they receive input from fibres encoding a wide range of frequencies
\citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,SmithRhode:1989,PaoliniClark:1999}.

Axonal projections of DS cell spread locally in the AVCN and PVCN, then head
dorsally toward the \DCN
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,DoucetRossEtAl:1999,DoucetRyugo:1997,DoucetRyugo:2006}.
Some \DS axons are also commissural fibres, crossing the midline to terminate in
the contralateral \CN \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}, inhibiting
bushy and stellate cells \citep{BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.

** Tuberculoventral Cells

# Alibardi:2003 In layer 3 of the DCN, glycinergic vertical neurons are present,
# and they have specific nuclear and synaptic characteristics that distinguish
# them from Golgi-stellate cells present in the same layer (Saint-Marie et
# al. 1991; Wickesber & Oertel, 1993; Alibardi, 1999b, 2000a). Vertical (or
# tuberculo-ventral) neurons form a local circuit that connects the dorsal to
# the ventral cochlear nuclei, and also contact the basal dendrites of pyramidal
# cells (Saint-Marie et al. 1991, 1993; Wickesberg & Oertel, 1993; Ferragamo et
# al. 1998).


# Tuberculoventral neurons in the deep layer of the \DCN provide a delayed,
# frequency-specific glycinergic inhibition to TS and DS cells in the \VCN
# \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1988}.  The dendrites of TV cells are
# aligned with \ANFs and indicating narrow frequency tuning. TV cells have low
# spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs; “pauser,” “chopper,” or
# “onset/sustained” have been recorded
# \citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
# response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are
# non-monotonic functions of intensity.

*** Morphology and Cellular Mechanisms of Tuberculoventral cells

Tuberculoventral neurons in the deep layer of the DCN provide a delayed,
frequency-specific glycinergic inhibition to TS and DS cells in the \VCN
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1988}.  Planar multipolar or vertical
cells are the most populated in the deep layers of the \DCN and correspond to
neurons with a Type II \EIRA \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999} and are
immunolabelled with glycine.  Not all vertical cells send axonal collaterals to
the \VCN \citep{Rhode:1999} and not all Type II units can be antidromically
activated by shocks to the \VCN The dendrites of \TV cells are aligned with
\ANFs and indicating narrow frequency tuning.


\TV axons exit the \DCN via the lateral tuberculoventral tract, transversing the
\GCD and terminating in the \PVCN and the \AVCN\@. Anterograde labelling in the
DCN suggests glycinergic \TV cells project tonotopically to the VCN not just
on-CF, but also to the low and high frequency side bands in the AVCN
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1993,WickesbergOertel:1988,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991,Wickesberg:1996,OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004}.


Ultra-structural labelling of synapses in the rat DCN suggest TV cells are
inhibited by \DS cells and from \GABA, glycine and mixed sources in the \DCN
\citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.  Intracellular responses from labeled \TV cells in the
mouse show clear excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse inhibitory input
from DS cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}; however, excitatory inputs were not
found from TS cells in rats \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.


The intracellular properties of \TV cells recorded \textit{in vitro} they have a
classic type I regular-spiking response to current clamp and action potentials
with double exponential plus undershoots
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,WickesbergOertel:1990,YoungBrownell:1976,YoungVoigt:1981,ZhangOertel:1993b}.
Hyperpolarisation undershoots after a spike suggest the presence of low
threshold potassium channels (\IKLT) \citep{ManisMarx:1991,RothmanManis:2003}.




*** TODO Acoustic Response of Tuberculoventral cells

\TV cells have low spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs
(pause-build, unusual chopper, or onset with sustained activity) have been
recorded \citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are non-monotonic
functions of intensity.

# Responses of tuberculoventral neurons to sound
Recordings \textit{in vivo} indicate that tuberculoventral cells probably have
type II characteristics and respond with “chopper” temporal response patterns
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}. Units with type II responses are sharply tuned, they
have thresholds - 10 dB higher than other units with which they are
intermingled, and they do not respond to broad-band noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungBrownell:1976,Young:1980,SachsYoung:1980,YoungVoigt:1982,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1990,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,Rhode:1999}. Young
and his colleagues have shown that most neurons in the deep DCN respond to sound
with either of two major types of response maps, type II or type IV
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1980,VoigtYoung:1990,Young:1980,YoungBrownell:1976}.

** Golgi Cells
# as sources of \GABAergic inputs

\glsreset{GLG} \glsreset{GCD}

\GLG cells lie in the \GCD of the ventral cochlear nucleus and are possible
source of GABAergic input to D and T stellate cells
\citep{Mugnaini:1985,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
GABAergic inputs from periolivary neurons are also known to project to the \VCN
\citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}. Intracellular recordings from T and D stellate
cells indicate a significant GABAergic influence that is present in slices where
the cochlear nucleus is isolated from olivary connections
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Latency of excitation to AN shocks suggests
Golgi cells are activated by type II auditory nerve fibres
\citep{BensonBerglundEtAl:1996,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Therefore, type II
auditory nerve fibres could be involved in gain control through GABAergic
modulation of activity in the \VCN\@.


Golgi cells are distinguished from the numerous smaller granule cells by larger
cell body and surrounding plexus of dendritic and axonal neurites. The soma
diameter of Golgi cells is approximately 15 \um
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, where the diameter of granule cells is 8 \um
in cats \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980} and 6 \um in rats and mice
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,Alibardi:2003}.  Smooth, tapering dendrites,
between 50 and 100 \um long, emanated in all directions (mice:
\citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, see also
\citealt{Cant:1993,MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}).  A dense, axonal plexus, limited to
the plane of the granule cell domain, extend about 250 \um from the soma in all
directions \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,BensonBrown:2004}.

The dendrites of \VCN Golgi cells are mitochondria-rich and make glomeruli
complexes with long synaptic junctions with the mossy fibre boutons
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}. The somata generally have few boutons of flat or
pleomorphic vesicle type, characteristic of glycinergic and GABAergic
terminals. Along with inhibitory boutons, the dendrites also receive excitatory
input with large (type I\space \ANF) and small (type II\space \ANF and granule
cell) vesicles
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Ryugo:2008}.


#  \citep{Alibardi:2003} In non-tonotopic circuits integration between acoustic
# and non-acoustic inputs occurs \citep{RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993}.

# The contribution of the circuits of granule cell areas of the cochlear nuclear
# complex to the processing of the acoustic signal is poorly understood (Kane,
# 1974, 1977; Mugnaini et al. 1980; 1984, 1997; Hutson and Morest, 1996; Wedman
# et al. 1996; Morest, 1997; Hurd et al. 1999).  For a review of non-auditory
# inputs to GCD see \citealt{OhlroggeDoucetEtAl:2001}.



# # from Mugnaini This paper describes the fine structure of granule cells and
# granule-associated interneurons (termed Golgi cells) in the cochlear nuclei of
# cat, rat and mouse.  Granule cells and Golgi cells are present in defined
# regions of ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei collectively termed "cochlear
# granule cell domain'. The granule cells are small neurons with two or three
# short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with terminal
# expansions. These participate in glomerular synaptic arrays similar to those
# of the cerebellar cortex. In the glomeruli the dendrites form short type 1
# synapses with a large, centrally-located mossy bouton containing round
# synaptic vesicles and type 2 synapses with peripherally located, smaller
# boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles. The granule cell axons is thin and
# beaded and, on its way to the molecular layer of the \DCN, takes a straight
# course, which in ventral nucleus is parallel to the pial surface. Neurons of
# the second category resemble cerebellar Golgi cells and occur everywhere
# interspersed among the granule cells. They are usually larger than the granule
# cells and give rise to dendrites which may branch close to and curve around
# the cell body. The dendrites contain numerous mitochondria and are laden with
# thin appendages, giving them a hairy appearance.  Both the cell body and the
# stem dendrites participate in glomerular synaptic arrays.  Golgi cell
# glomeruli are distinguishable from the granule cell glomeruli by unique
# features of the dendritic profiles and by longer, type 1 synaptic junctions
# with the central mossy bouton.  The Golgi cell axon forms a beaded plexus
# close to the parent cell body. The synaptic vesicle population of the mossy
# boutons suggests that they are a heterogeneous group and may have multiple
# origins.  Apparently, each of the various classes participates in both granule
# and Golgi cell glomeruli.  The smaller peripheral boutons with pleomorphic
# vesicles in the two types of glomeruli may represent Golgi cell axons which
# make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell axons
# which make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell
# dendrites, on the other hand, are also contacted by small boutons en passant
# with round synaptic vesicles, which may represent granule cell axons. A
# tentative scheme of the circuitry in the cochlear granule cell domain is
# presented. The similarity with the cerebellar granule cell layer is striking.

*** Cellular Mechanisms of Golgi Cells


Intracellular recordings of Golgi cells, in one study in mice, have shown a
classic repetitively-firing response to current clamp and an inward rectifying
response to voltage clamp \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Golgi cells are
classified as type I and act as simple integrators of synaptic input
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
# Their intrinsic properties suggests Golgi cells are simple integrators.
Response to AN shocks in Golgi cells were delayed by approximately 0.7 ms
relative to the core \VCN units, with minimum delay in most cells around 1.3 ms
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

*** TODO Acoustic Response of Golgi cells


# The physiological response of Golgi cells has not been extensively studied.

Extracellular recordings from labelled Golgi cells are not available in the
literature; however, an electrophysiological study of the \GCD  (or marginal
shell of the \VCN  in cats) has been done by one group
\citep{Ghoshal:1997,GhoshalKim:1997,GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a} without
direct labelling of recorded units.  Any extracellular spikes recorded in the
\GCD\space are most likely from Golgi cells since granule cell somata are less than 10
\um and their narrow axons are unlikely to elicit electrical activity in the
electrodes \citet{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

## Change this sentence
# There was a substantial presence of

Strongly driven units in the AVCN shell exhibiting non-saturating rate-level
functions to pure tone, noise or both with dynamic ranges as wide as 89 dB.  The
majority of recorded \GCD units were classified as type I/III or III\space \EIRA
units, showing a monotonic increase in firing rate with increasing sound
intensity to tones and noise
\citep[Figure~\ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2},][]{GhoshalKim:1997}.  Some units examined
did show type II or type IV\space \EIRA properties. Unit *XX* in was classified as
type II due to its poor response to noise but it did not show a reduction of
response to tones at high \SPL (typical of \DCN type II units)
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. Two units with low \CF ($<$ 1.5 kHz) were classified as
type II\space \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The \PSTH of the units included wide
chopper, \OnC, and pause-build, however nearly one third of units did not fit
into the known classifications and were called unusual \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.


The latency of acoustically driven \GCD recorded units range from 2.4 ms to over
10 ms, centred on 3.75 ms.  The acoustic latency closely matches the minimum
latency of \EPSPs to AN shocks recorded in mice /in vitro/ preparations
\citep[1.3~ms,][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Longer latencies (>10 ms) may be
due to type II\space \ANFs (estimated theoretical latency \sim 10 ms
\citep{Brown:1993}) or from polysynaptic excitation by granule cells.


# Their monotonic responses to tones and noise over a wide dynamic range
# provides regulation of activity in granule cells that also receive
# non-acoustic input.  The contribution of a delayed, negative feedback onto
# \VCN~units is analogous to automatic gain control.  provides strong evidence
# for regulation of activity in granule cells.

The general assumption of the functional role of Golgi cells is to regulate
granule cells but they may also provide automatic gain control to the principal
\VCN units, primarily D and T stellate cells
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

** Function of Physiological Responses in the Stellate Microcircuit

*** Functional Role of Inhibition

The actions of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition are thought to play
different spectro-temporal processing roles in the cochlear nucleus.
Glycinergic inputs from D stellate and Tuberculoventral cells are predominantly
active at the onset of stimuli; accordingly they provide enhanced temporal
acuity and dynamic range at onset.  Post onset and tonic inhibition is provided
by \GABA inputs.  GABAergic inhibition acting on slow and fast receptors (\GABAa
and GABAB respectively) is likely to mediate the strong post-onset inhibition in
D stellate cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,EvansZhao:1998}.  TS cells are
weakly inhibited by \GABA\space \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} reflecting the
smaller number of GABAergic synapses \citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}.
GABAergic inhibition in the \VCN is derived from a number of possible sources,
intrinsically from Golgi cells in the granule cell layer of the \VCN or
extrinsically from olivocochlear efferents \citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}.


Axo-somatic inhibition from flat and pleomorphic terminals has been observed
adjoining prominently on D stellate cells and could possibly explain the OnC
response to tones and noise.  Evidence of axo-dendritic inhibition on T stellate
cells \citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989} led Sachs and colleagues to suggest that
T stellate cells overcome saturation of high spontaneous rate AN fibres by
proximal inhibitory inputs that shunt excitation from more distal inputs
\citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987,WangSachs:1994}. This mechanism was explored by
using steady-state continuous inputs \citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994} and using more
realistic inhibitory circuits \citep{EagerGraydenEtAl:2004}.


GABAergic inhibition regulates the level of activity in the \VCN
\citep{PalombiCaspary:1992}, The application of bicuculine abolishes the onset
response of \OnC and \OnL units \citep{EvansZhao:1998,PalombiCaspary:1992}.
Bicuculine, a \GABAa antagonist, raises the threshold and significantly
increases OnC receptive field to high and low frequencies, up to 10 times the
receptive field width of AN fibres \citep{EvansZhao:1998}.  Facilitation of
response by spectral inputs outside the conventional receptive field
\citep{WinterPalmer:1995,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996}, indicate the presence of tonic
inhibition in \OnC units.  Inhibition acting post onset is likely to be a
dominant factor in their onset response properties rather than membrane based
mechanisms \citep{EvansZhao:1998}.  OnC showed little difference in response to
cosine or random phase harmonics, which improves temporal encoding of
fundamental in echoic situations \citep{EvansZhao:1998}. The post-onset
inhibition can last for up to 200--400msec, as observed by hyperpolarisation of
the soma potential \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004} and a reduction in spontaneous
firing rate \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}. \citet{MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2004}
demonstrated the co-localisation of glycine and \GABA transporters by
immunofluorescence labelling of endings contacting spherical bushy cells. The
functional significance of co-localisation of these two inhibitory
neurotransmitters is uncertain, but it is possible that glycinergic transmission
may be modulated by the activation of pre- and postsynaptic \GABAa receptors
\citep{LimAlvarezEtAl:2000}.


Mixed Glycine/\GABA terminals, observed with pleomorphic vesicles, have been
observed in the \VCN\space \citep{AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993}, but these are most
likely from \GABA and \GAD immunoreactive periolivary neurons whose axons
terminate in the \VCN (cats: \citep{Adams:1983,SpanglerCantEtAl:1987},guinea
pig:
HelfertBonneauEtAl:1989,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1990,Schofield:1991,QiuWangEtAl:1995}.
rat: \citealt{CamposCaboEtAl:2001}.  Periolivary neurons receive afferent input
from monotonic units in the \VCN \citep{Schofield:1995,Schofield:2002} and are
thought to play a role in sound duration
\citep{DehmelKopp-ScheinpflugEtAl:2002,KadnerKuleszaEtAl:2006,KuleszaKadnerEtAl:2007}.

  4. Activation of \NMDA
     - \citep{CaoOertel:2010} shows TS cells activate large currents through

     - integration window longest for choppers \citep{McGinleyOertel:2006}
     - inhibition from high \CF units alters \FSL to tones \citep{Wickesberg:1996}

     - Onset: Volley of Excitation + feed-forward excitation + DS inhibition
     - After onset: Phasic excitation + feed-forward excitation + \NMDA
       activation + TV inhibition (+ small DS inhibition) + \GABA inhibition =
       stable excitation but loss of temporal features

*** Synchronisation to Amplitude Modulated Tones


The temporal modulation transfer function measures the precision of
phase-locking to envelope modulations of a \CF tone by different \fms.  Frisina
and colleagues first showed that phase-locking to \AM in the \CN is enhanced
relative to the auditory nerve \citep{Frisina:1983,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}.  A
number of studies have shown that the fundamental frequency is represented as an
interval code in most cochlear nucleus units
\citep{CarianiDelgutte:1996,Rhode:1995,Rhode:1998}.  Modulated signals have been
used extensively to analyse temporal coding in the cochlear nucleus
\citep{Moller:1976,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,KimSirianniEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994,Rhode:1994}.
Some response types in the cochlear nucleus preserve envelope information over a
wide range of stimulus levels, even above 100 dB \SPL, where \ANFs have reduced
synchronisation \citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1994,Rhode:1994}.
Studies of modulation in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus show a hierarchy of
enhancement: \OnC \to \ChS,\ChT \to \PL, \PLn
\citep{WangSachs:1994,Rhode:1998,RecioRhode:2000}. This enhancement is relative,
since choppers only phase-lock to modulations below 500Hz, \PL and \PLn units
perform better at higher modulation frequencies \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.


The coding of AM in neurons is measured using a \MTF, which is calculated using
its firing rate (\rMTF) or temporal information (\tMTF). The degree of phase
locking is measured by the synchronisation coefficient or vector strength
\citep{GoldbergBrownell:1973,GoldbergBrown:1969}.  The synchronisation index
(SI) is calculated by Equation \ref{eq:SI} \cite{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}:
# Statistical signiﬁcance of synchronization is usually quantiﬁed with the Rayleigh test \cite{BuunenRhode:1978,MardiaJupp:1999}
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:SI}
   SI = \frac{\sqrt{\left(\sum_{i}^{n} x_i \right)^{2} + \left(\sum_{i}^{n} y_i \right)^{2} }}{n}
\end{equation} \noindent where $x_{i} = \cos\theta_{i}$, $x_{i} =
\sin\theta_{i}$, and /n/ is the number of spike times.  Each spike is treated as
a vector of unit length and with phase $\theta_{i}$ between 0 and $2\pi$
measured as the spike time modulo of the stimulus period, $1/f_{m}$.  Perfect
synchronisation will give SI = 1, whereas values below 0.1 are considered
insignificant.  The SI values are combined for each modulation frequency to
create the \tMTF\@.  Vector strength and Rayleigh coefficient, calculated to
verify the statistical significance of synchronisation, can also be obtained
from the Fourier spectrum of the PST or period histogram, in which case it
equals the magnitude of the ﬁrst harmonic, normalised by the DC component
(average ﬁring rate).  Phase is also retrieved with either technique.  The rate
measure (rMTF) is calculated from the mean firing rate in the PSTH, between 20
ms and the end of the stimulus.

In the gerbil, chopper units generally have band-pass \tMTF at high \SPL, with
the \fm inducing the highest synchronisation called the \BMF
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}. Rhode and colleagues confirmed band-pass \tMTFs
as well as some band-pass rate-based \MTFs in chopper units in the cat
\citep{Rhode:1994,RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  The \BMF of chopper units lie between
50 and 500Hz (gerbil and cat).  OnC units are well suited to encode a wide range
of fm with strong synchronisation due their precise onset Kim

*** Vowel Representation in the Auditory Periphery

The representation of vowels in the auditory periphery has been studied using
recordings from a large population of auditory nerve fibres
\citep{SachsYoung:1979,YoungSachs:1979,DelgutteKiang:1984,DelgutteKiang:1984a,DelgutteKiang:1984b,DelgutteKiang:1984c}
and cochlear nucleus cells
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997,RecioRhode:2000}.  Recent
reviews of vowel encoding in the \VCN\space \citep{May:2003,PalmerShamma:2003}
highlighted the spectral enhancement of formant peaks and suppression of formant
troughs by chopper units. Figure \ref{fig:May2003} shows the estimated
rate-place representation of auditory nerve and \VCN units.  \HSR\space \ANFs
and primary-like \VCN units show saturation of trough frequencies at moderate
sound levels.  \LSR units in the AN and \LSR primary-like \VCN units are
presumably able to encode spectrum at high \SPL\@.  The rate-place representation
in chopper units (\ChS and \ChT) show considerable robustness to intensity
(right panels in Fig.\space \ref{fig:May2003}).  Suppression of spectral troughs
in the rate-place representation of \ChT and \ChS units is greater than the
suppression in \LSR\space \ANFs at high \SPL\@.  Spectral enhancement in T
stellate cells cannot be attributed to lateral suppression in the auditory
nerve; it requires some form of lateral inhibitory mechanism that can perform
spectral enhancement by suppression of noise between peaks.

\citep{EvansNelson:1973,Young:1984,RhodeGreenberg:1994a}.  \ChT \TS cells
exhibit strong side-band inhibition and respond to vowels with a clear and
stable representation of acoustic spectrum in their average firing rate at all
stimulus levels \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,MayPrellEtAl:1998,RecioRhode:2000}.
Selective listening to low and high spontaneous rate \ANFs could be one possible
mechanism \citep{WinslowBartaEtAl:1987}.  \TS cells do receive inhibitory inputs
\citep{Cant:1981,SmithRhode:1989,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} hence they are
candidates for operation of lateral inhibition.  Also, recurrent excitation by
TS cells within the same frequency band could increase the rate.





* Synaptic Organisation in the Stellate Microcircuit

Histological and immunohistochemistry labelling techniques have produced a flood
of information about the anatomy, physiology, pharmacology and intrinsic
membrane properties of the different cell types in the CN\@. The synaptic
organisation of cells in the cochlear nucleus of has been examined in detail in
various species (cat:
\citealt{Cant:1981,TolbertMorest:1982,SaintMorestEtAl:1989}, mice:
\citealt{WickesbergOertel:1988,WickesbergOertel:1990,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991},
guinea pig: \citealt{JuizHelfertEtAl:1996,OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}, Rat:
\citealt{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003,RubioJuiz:2004}).

Physiological studies combined with labelling have given greater certainty to
correlations between physiological response types and morphological cell types
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,DoucetRyugo:2006}.
Intracellular recordings have ascertained the electrical properties and the
different synaptic inputs of TS, DS, TV, and GLG cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,ZhangOertel:1993b}.


Descriptions of current dynamics for synaptic receptors
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999,HartyManis:1998,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005} and
membrane channels
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b} specific to the
\VCN enable accurate mathematical models at the cell and synaptic level.


This section provides highly detailed information regarding the synapses and
connectivity in the T stellate microcircuit.  Given sufficient information a
realistic biological model of the stellate network is attainable and can provide
further insights into processing of acoustic information.  The necessity of such
detailed information is essential to produce a biophysically-realistic model to
observe more complex phenomena in the neural output.  The first part details 


Table
\ref{tab:Connections}, included at the end of this section, gives a final
summary of the synaptic connections


** Receptors and Neurotransmitters

Axon terminals (boutons) in the cochlear nucleus are of three main types: (1)
asymmetric FP-boutons, containing numerous flat and pleomorphic synaptic
vesicles and storing glycine and sometimes GABA; (2) P-boutons, mainly
containing pleomorphic vesicles and storing GABA; and (3) asymmetric R-boutons,
containing large or small spherical synaptic vesicles and storing glutamate or
acetylcholine
\citep{Ottersen:1990,Wenthold:1991,Cant:1992,AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993,SaintOstapoffEtAl:1993,Alibardi:2003}.

*** Glutamatergic AMPA synapses

Evidence for glutamate synapses in the cochlear nucleus, specifically \AMPA
glutamate receptors, has been established in many mammals (guinea pigs:
\citealt{FexWenthold:1976,HackneyOsenEtAl:1996}, cats:
\citealt{AdamsMugnaini:1987}, rats:
\citealt{SchweitzerJensenEtAl:1991,RubioJuiz:1998,RubioWenthold:1999,RubioJuiz:2004,Rubio:2006,ItoBishopEtAl:2011},
gerbil: \citealt{KoradaSchwartz:2000}, bats: \citealt{KemmerVater:2001}, barn
owl: \citealt{LevinKubkeEtAl:1997}, primate: \citealt{RubioGudsnukEtAl:2008}).

Type I auditory nerve fibre synapses form glutamatergic \AMPA receptors on
neurons of the cochlear nucleus
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,WentholdHunterEtAl:1993}.  Histological
measures of labelled T stellate cells show the presence of glutamate and
glutamine antibodies \citep{HackneyOsenEtAl:1990,WentholdHunterEtAl:1993}.  More
advanced measures using electron microscopy reveal \AMPA subunits, unique to the
cochlear nucleus, apposing bushy and TS cells \citep{WangWentholdEtAl:1998}.
Pharmacologic experiments have also confirmed monosynaptic \EPSPs from AN shocks
are blocked by the \AMPA antagonist DNQX in DS and TS cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Glutamatergic \NMDA receptors may also be
present at \ANF synapses \citep[mice:][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} and can be
activated to produce large synaptic currents \citep{CaoOertel:2010}.


Whole cell patch recordings in rats show \NMDA dominance at birth, then reverses
during development leaving little to no observable \NMDA\space \EPSCs at the soma in
mature rats \citep{BellinghamLimEtAl:1998}.
# %\citep{Oertel:1983}
Five percent of \ANFs are unmyelinated type II fibres (cat:
\citealt{KiangRhoEtAl:1982}, mice: \citealt{Ehret:1979}).  possibly mediated by
\NMDA receptors or en-passant endings with reduced glutamate uptake
\citep{JosephsonMorest:2003,BensonBrown:2004,Ryugo:2008,RyugoHaenggeliEtAl:2003,RyugoParks:2003}.


The AMPA receptor is composed of four different protein subunits, termed \GluRs
 1--4. The functional properties of each AMPA receptor are determined by the
 relative levels of GluRs 1--4  \citep[see~review][]{Parks:2000}.

# The AMPA receptor is composed of four different protein subunits, termed \GluRs 1--4. The
# functional properties of each AMPA receptor are determined by the relative levels of GluRs 1^4
# The AMPA receptors of some auditory neurons in birds and mammals also appear to
# express AMPA receptors with specialized functional properties.  As discussed
# below in more detail, several types of auditory neuron have AMPA receptors with
# unusually high permeability to divalent cations and very rapid desensitisation and deactivation rates; the latter properties have been identified as
# specic to the auditory pathway
# \citep{RamanZhangEtAl:1994,GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}

RNA expression in \ANFs show no \GluR 1 but moderate to high levels of \GluRs
2--4, and type II\space ANFs expressing significantly more \GluR 2
\citep{NiedzielskiSafieddineEtAl:1997,NiedzielskiWenthold:1995}.  \EPSPs that
are rapidly decaying, rapidly desensitising, calcium-permeable, and high
sensitivity to block by philanthotoxin in \AVCN neurons are mediated by unique
\AMPA receptors
\citep{IsaacsonWalmsley:1995,GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999,Parks:2000}.
Immunoreactivity studies of AMPA subunits in \VCN show mRNA expression of high
levels of \GluR 3 and moderate levels of \GluR 2 and 4c
\citep{CaicedoEybalin:1999,Parks:2000}.  Granule cells in the DCN, and in
the VCN, expressed low to moderate levels of GluR2 mRNA and moderate levels of
GluR4 but no GluR1 or GluR3 message.  ANF terminals express the vesicle
transporter VGluR1 gene
\citep{ZhouNannapaneniEtAl:2007,AltschulerTongEtAl:2008}. Gene expression of
excitatory vesicle transporters has shown T stellate and bushy cells express
both VGluR1 and VGluR2 \citep{ItoBishopEtAl:2011}. Excitatory cells in the \DCN
(fusiform and giant cells) only express VGluR2, while granule cells only
expressed VGluR1 similar to the cerebellar granule cells
\citep{ItoBishopEtAl:2011}.


The dynamics of the \AMPA receptor synapse varies between cell types in the
cochlear nucleus
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:2001,Gardner:2000,GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}.  The
fast onset of \mEPSPs in CN neurons is followed by a single-exponential decay,
measuring 0.36 ms in octopus, T and D stellate cells and 0.4 ms in
Tuberculoventral cells \citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}.  The time constant of
deactivation after glutamate puffs (0.37 ms) matched the time of the \mEPSPs
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:2001}.  The slow decay time constant in parallel
fibre synapses for fusiform and cartwheel cells, 1.17 and 1.99 ms, and
desensitisation 3.9 and 4.4 ms respectively. These synapses are most likely
mediated by granule cells or type II\space ANFs.

*** Glycinergic synapses

Evidence of glycine in the cochlear nucleus, through staining or
immunohistochemistry, has been studied in many species including guinea pigs
\citep{JuizHelfertEtAl:1996a,HelfertBonneauEtAl:1989,Wenthold:1987,WentholdHuieEtAl:1987,AltschulerBetzEtAl:1986,SaintBensonEtAl:1991,KolstonOsenEtAl:1992,PeyretCampistronEtAl:1987,Alibardi:2003a,MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2004,MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2000,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002},
rats
\citep{OsenLopezEtAl:1991,Mugnaini:1985,AokiSembaEtAl:1988,GatesWeedmanEtAl:1996,Alibardi:2003,LimOleskevichEtAl:2003,SrinivasanFriaufEtAl:2004,DoucetRossEtAl:1999},
mice
\citep{WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991,LimOleskevichEtAl:2003,YangDoievEtAl:2002},
cats \citep{OsenOttersenEtAl:1990,SmithRhode:1989}, baboons
\citep{MooreOsenEtAl:1996}, gerbils \citep{GleichVater:1998}, and bats
\citep{KemmerVater:2001a}.  Flat vesicles, closely associated with glycine
terminals, have been shown to be present in terminals apposed to TS units with
one axon traced back to DS cell body (cat: \citep{SmithRhode:1989}).  Glycine
GlyR receptors inhibited by strychnine are the only glycinergic receptor
observed in intracellular experiments (mice:
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}).  Gene expression of inhibitory vesicle
transporters labelled cells sparsely in the in the \VCN and \GCD, presumably D
stellate and Golgi cells \citep{ItoBishopEtAl:2011}.


The fast dynamics of the glycinergic GlyR synapse is essential for transmitting
temporal information to higher centres.  Early studies in \VCN slice
preparations, the estimated the decay time constant varied from 1.6 ms in mice
\citep{Oertel:1983} to 6--13 ms in guinea pigs \citep{HartyManis:1998}. The
average of /in vitro/ studies at room temperature found values around 5 ms
\citep{OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergOertel:1993,HartyManis:1998}.  In the
\AVCN bushy cells of mice, \citet{LimOleskevichEtAl:2003} estimated the GlyR
decay time constant equates to 2.5 ms at body temperature.  In more recent
developments, spontaneous \IPSCs in \MNTB neurons in rats (a close analogue of
neurons in the \VCN core) provide an accurate measure or the dynamics of the
receptor (\twd). The weighted decay time constant of \IPSCs in young rats ($3.9
\pm 0.5$ ms) is a combination of (\tfast and \tslow) In very young rats the GlyR
\mIPSCs were not as developed with a decay time constant of $5.47 \pm 0.19$ ms
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}.  \citet{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2004} measured
the miniature \IPSCs in mature rats and found the fast exponential dominated
($\tfast = 2.1 \pm 0.1$ msec).  Even after high frequency train stimuli,
glycinergic \IPSCs returned to a steady decay of $2.8 \pm 0.4$ ms (\MNTB neurons
at 37\degC in young rats \citealt{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}).

The rise time (10\%-90\%) of \IPSCs at room temperature is faster glycinergic
\mIPSCs in mice \AVCN bushy cells ($0.46 \pm 0.05$ ms,
\citealt{LimOleskevichEtAl:2003}) compared to \mIPSCs rat \MNTB neurons ($0.60
\pm 0.03$ ms, \citealt{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}). The estimated rise-time of
GlyR at body temperature is 0.8 ms \citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}.

# Evoked \IPSCs had an average \tfast of $2.9 \pm 0.3$ msec (96% of the fit) and a \tslow  of 12.3--16.4 msec.
# At physiological temperatures, glycinergic \mIPSCs were fast as those measured at
# room temperature ($\tfast =0.8 \pm 0.2$ msec). The evoked \IPSCs
# were also briefer at 37\degC ($\tfast=1.0 \pm 0.2$ msec) (Fig. 2
# A).
#Rise 0.4 ms, Decay 2.5 ms (spontaneous \IPSCs in rat \MNTB neurons,
#\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}) The rise time of glycinergic \IPSCs was
#consistent across rodents also measured $0.46 \pm 0.05$ ms spontaneous \IPSCs In
#\AVCN bushy cells in mice \citep{LimOleskevichEtAl:2003}.
#
# Decay 6--13 ms (Slice prep 30 C degrees; \VCN guinea pig \citep{HartyManis:1998}).
# Activation to 1mM Gly 2.0$\pm$1.2 ms (range 0.8 to 4.6 ms), deactivation to 1s Gly \tfast 15.5 ms and \t[[latex:textrm][slow]] = 73.4 ms \citep[\MNTB mice:][]{LeaoOleskevichEtAl:2004}.
#Decay 1.6 ms \citep[mice \VCN,]{Oertel:1983}
#Decay 5.4 ms \citep{OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergOertel:1993}
#Activation $2.0 \pm 1.2$ ms Decay 5.3 ms (Gly puffs at 22\degC (Q_{10} 2.1) in  guinea pig \VCN \citep{HartyManis:1998})

*** GABAergic GABA_A synapses

# GABAergic \GABA$_{\textrm{A}}$ receptor  (bicuculine-sensitive \VCN T stellate cell, mice slice preparation \citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, chinchilla \citealt{JosephsonMorest:1998})
# Ferragamo et al. 1998 found no GABAergic \IPSPs but the cells were still sensitive to bicuculine

# \GABA staining in the \VCN \citep{SaintMorestEtAl:1989}


Markers of GABAergic neurotransmission in the cochlear nucleus reveal the
presence of both cell bodies and terminals that could be GABAergic. Antibodies
to \GABA conjugates and to \GAD generally label neurons that are functionally
GABAergic. Occasionally \GAD and \GABA are associated with neurons that are
functionally glycinergic; cartwheel cells of the \DCN, for example, are labeled
for \GABA and \GAD yet seem to be glycinergic
\citep{GoldingOertel:1997,GoldingOertel:1996,Golding:1996}.  Functionally
GABAergic neurons and their terminals are labeled consistently for \GABA and
\GAD, however, indicating that the source of GABAergic input in T stellate cells
would be expected to be labeled. GABAergic input could arise from neurons
intrinsic to the cochlear nuclei or from sites external to the nucleus, such as
the superior olivary nucleus \citep{SaintMorestEtAl:1989}. Only GABAergic
neurons in the cochlear nuclei can function in polysynaptic circuits in slices
as was observed mice \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}, however, isolated
terminals of extrinsic sources cannot be activated synaptically.


Golgi cells are the only GABAergic neuron in the \VCN and lie within the granule
cell domains around the \VCN and terminate near the fine distal dendrites of T
and D stellate cells. Despite the lack of \IPSPs or \IPSCs, the presence of
\GABAa receptors and their response changes to bicuculine in isolated \VCN
slices, the evidence for synaptic connectivity between Golgi cells and the two
\VCN stellate cells is strong
\citep{WuOertel:1986,OertelWickesberg:1993,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
# Markers of GABAergic neurotransmission in the cochlear

# Labeling for \GAD and \GABA is associated strongly with
# regions that contain granule cells, the molecular and fusiform
# cell layers of the \DCN and the superficial granule cell do-
# main of the \VCN\@. In cats and guinea pigs, antibodies to
# \GABA conjugates and to \GAD, a biosynthetic enzyme, have
# been shown to label specific groups of cells and terminals
# (\GABA: Kolston et al. 1992; Osen et al. 1990; Wenthold et
# al. 1986; \GAD: Adams and Mugnaini 1987; Moore and
# Moore 1987; Mugnaini 1985; Saint Marie et al. 1989). In
# the \DCN, the majority of cell bodies and puncta that were
# labeled with antibodies against \GABA and \GAD lie in the
# superficial and fusiform cell layers (Adams and Mugnaini
# 1987; Kolston et al. 1992; Moore and Moore 1987; Mugnaini
# 1985; Osen et al. 1990; Saint Marie et al. 1989; Wenthold
# et al. 1986). Labeled neurons are cartwheel, stellate, and
# Golgi cells. As none of these neurons make direct or indirect
# connections with the \VCN, it is unlikely that cartwheel,
# superficial stellate or Golgi cells of the \DCN contribute to
# GABAergic inhibition in T stellate cells of the \VCN\@.
# GABAergic input to T stellate cells of the \VCN could
# arise from Golgi cells in the superficial granule cell domain
# either mono- or disynaptically. Labeled cell bodies identified
# as Golgi cells were observed to be associated with the super-
# ficial granule cell layer (Mugnaini 1985). These neurons
# terminate locally in the superficial granule cell layer with
# very dense terminal arbours that abut the underlying large
# cell area (Ferragamo et al. 1997). The dendrites of D stellate
# cells lie just beneath the superficial granule cell domain,
# poised to be contacted by Golgi cells proximally and distally,
# indicating that D stellate cells could mediate GABAergic
# responses. Furthermore, some of the branches of the distal
# dendrites of T stellate cells approach the superficial granule
# cell domain. If Golgi cells contact T stellate cells directly,
# those contacts can only be on distal dendrites. In contrast
# with glycinergic \IPSPs, GABAergic \IPSPs were not promi-
# nent in T or D stellate cells; \IPSPs that remained in the
# presence of strychnine were small and inconspicuous, if
# present. There are four possible reasons for this observation:
# the synaptic currents associated with GABAergic inputs
# were relatively slower and weaker, they were generated rela-
# tively far from the somatic recording site, they were medi-
# ated through an excitatory interneuron, or there were presyn-
# aptic GABAergic receptors present.
# \citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}
# To ascertain if GABAergic transmission persisted
# in still older animals (P17–P22 rats), we positioned the stim-
# ulating electrode after the slices were bathed in 500 nM
# strychnine. Under these conditions, small, slow \IPSCs (weighted time constant = 24 $\pm$ 4 ms) could be
# evoked, indicating that weak GABAergic inputs persist in
# more mature \MNTB
GABAergic synapses were evoked in mature \MNTB neurons (slice preparation bathed
in strychnine) with slow dynamics with a weighted time constant of $24 \pm 4$ ms
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}.

## Copied - > redo
In the adult \MNTB, neurons express a “slow” \GABAa receptor containing the
\alpha{}3 subunit (Campos et al. 2001). Consistent with these findings, decay
kinetics of GABAergic \mIPSCs were relatively slow (\twd = 20 ms) compared with
those synapses where the “fast” (\twd = 10 ms) \alpha{}1 subunits predominate
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2004} # (Bosman et al. 2002; Hollrigel and Soltesz
1997; Vicini et al. 2001).  \GABAa receptors may also be present outside of
synaptic terminals, due to the observation of enhanced recruitment when using
\GABA puffs \citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005}.  Hence, in the \MNTB, glycine
receptors are used in fast signalling pathways, whereas GABAergic systems may
mediate tonic inhibition through slower \GABAa receptors.


** Afferent input

*** ANF to VCN stellate cells

 #+latex: \textsc{Synapse type}: Auditory nerve fibre synapses on TS and DS cells
are glutamatergic \AMPA receptors
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,WentholdHunterEtAl:1993}.  Histological
measures of labelled T stellate cells show the presence of glutamate and
glutamine antibodies \citep{HackneyOsenEtAl:1990,WentholdHunterEtAl:1993}.  More
advanced measures using electron microscopy reveal \AMPA subunits, unique to the
cochlear nucleus, apposing TS cells \citep{WangWentholdEtAl:1998}.
Pharmacologic experiments have also confirmed monosynaptic \EPSPs from AN shocks
are be blocked by the \AMPA antagonist \DNQX
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. Glutamatergic \NMDA receptors may also be
present at \ANF synapses \citep[mice:][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} and can be
activated to produce large synaptic currents \citep{CaoOertel:2010}.  Whole cell
patch recordings show \NMDA dominance over \AMPA at birth reverses during
development, leaving little to no observable \NMDA\space \EPSCs at the soma in
mature rats \citep{BellinghamLimEtAl:1998}.

Five percent of \ANFs are unmyelinated type II fibres (cat:
\citep{KiangRhoEtAl:1982},mice: \citep{Ehret:1979} and their axons enter the
outer shell or \GCD where they are likely to terminate on distal dendrites of T
stellate cells using diffuse synapses, possibly mediated by \NMDA receptors or
the lack of glutamate re-uptake
\citep{BensonBrown:2004,Ryugo:2008,RyugoHaenggeliEtAl:2003,RyugoParks:2003}.
# (cats: Kiang et al. 1982; mice: Ehret 1979)
The dynamics of the \AMPA receptor synapse at DS and TS cells is a
single-exponential potential change, with decay time constant 0.36 ms
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts} The \ANF synaptic contacts on the cell body
of T stellate cells are relatively small, a distinguishing contrast between the
densely contacted D stellate cells
\citep{Cant:1981,Cant:1982,RyugoWrightEtAl:1993,TolbertMorest:1982a,FayPopper:1994,ReddCahillEtAl:2002,RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993,Ryugo:1992,RyugoParks:2003}.
The density of \ANF contacts on \TS cells diminish from the proximal dendrites
toward the distal ends \citep{SmithRhode:1989}.  \TS cells have \sim 30\%
somatic coverage, but less than 40\% of those contacts are from \ANFs
\citep{Cant:1981,Cant:1982,RyugoWrightEtAl:1993,TolbertMorest:1982a,SmithRhode:1989}.
\citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} estimated a small number of independent \ANFs
(4 to 6) were needed to reach AP in mice T stellate cells. All TS cells in the
chinchilla had 1--2 \ANF synapses surrounding the axon initial segment
\citep{JosephsonMorest:1998}.  Somatic excitatory contacts are highly variable
(mean 13 terminals, $36 \pm 10.5$ \% of somatic terminals in cat
\citealt{SmithRhode:1989}, 0--6 terminals per soma in chinchilla
\citealt{JosephsonMorest:1998}) suggesting variability in the physiological
response or segregation into different chopper subtypes.  Somatic and axon
hillock contacts increase the stochastic nature of the neuron's output as the
neuron's intrinsic mechanisms are surpassed by excitatory synapses near the
place of AP initiation.

D stellate cells have dense somatic and dendritic coverage of \ANF terminals
(mice:
\citealt{Cant:1981,Cant:1982,RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a},
cat \citealt{SmithRhode:1989}). \citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} confirmed
many weak inputs \ANF inputs drive \DS cells from shocks to the AN\@.
\citet{SmithRhode:1989} measured total area coverage of terminals on the soma,
proximal dendrites, and distal dendrites of one DS cell. The percentage of \ANF
terminals was 36\%, 62\%, and 25.5\%, respectively.  The \TAC for all synapses
was 87\%, 81\%, and 22\%, respectively.



# How chopping responses are produced is not completely understood. It has been
# suggested that stellate cells integrate input from large numbers of auditory nerve
# fibres. However, stellate cells in mice have been shown to receive input from only
# a few (four to six) sharply timed auditory nerve fibre inputs (175).  Activation of
# these inputs with trains of shocks produces entrained responses rather than
# chopping (172, 175), raising two questions: How are stellate cells prevented from
# encoding the timing of auditory nerve inputs after the initial action potential in
# response to sound, and how is their steady firing in response to tones produced
# from inputs that have strong onset transients?

 #+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: The estimated receptive field of single
\ANFs (\sim 70 \um \HSR, 100 \um \LSR
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,Ryugo:1992,BrownBerglundEtAl:1988,RoullierCronin-SchreiberEtAl:1986,FeketeRouillerEtAl:1984})
set the basis for the isofrequency laminae and medio-lateral tonotopicity across
the VCN\@.  The dendritic extent of TS cells perpendicular to the incoming \ANF
axons remain within the isofrequency lamina of the cell body (75-100 \um
\citep[mice:]{OertelWuEtAl:1990}).

The physiological receptive field is also similar between \ANFs and TS cells
\ChS \Qten=5.3 \citep[cat:][]{RhodeSmith:1986}, Choppers \Qten=$5.52\pm1.4$
compared to \Qten=6.3 in \ANFs \citep[guinea pig:]{JiangPalmerEtAl:1996}) but
varies with different TS cell classification subtypes (\ChS \Qten=4, \ChT
\Qten=2 (low \CF), and \Qten=3.67 (high \CF)
\citep[guinea~pig:]{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}) and the type of anaesthetic used in
the study (\Qten=7.4 unanaesthetised \Qten=5.3 barbiturate
\citep[cat:][]{RhodeKettner:1987}).

  The radial dendritic extent of \DS cells varies from 250 to 350 \um in rats
\citep{DoucetRyugo:1997}, or approximately one third of the tonotopic range in
gerbils \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.  The frequency response area to tones is
broad and centred on-\CF with a skew toward lower frequency lamina (guinea pig:
\Qten=$3.56 \pm 1.38$ \citep{JiangPalmerEtAl:1996}, \Qten = 1.33--2.87
\citep{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}, rat: \Qten=3.1 \citep{PaoliniClark:1999}).
Excitation is evident up to 1 octave above the \CF of \DS cells and 2 octaves
below the \CF in many studies (guinea pig [\citenum{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996},
gerbil: \citep{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2004,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, rat:
\citep{PaoliniClark:1998}).



 #+latex: \textsc{Delay}: The theoretical conductance delay from the cochlea to
the position of stellate cells in the \VCN, based on the average distance and
myelinated axon width, was estimated to be 0.5 ms
\citep{Brown:1993,BrownLedwith:1990}.  Oertel and colleagues first calculated
the delay experimentally using electrical shocks to the auditory nerve root in
slice preparations in mice \citep[0.7 ms,][]{Oertel:1983} and in chinchilla
\citep[0.5 ms,][]{WickesbergOertel:1993}. This was later confirmed in more
studies with delay $0.7 \pm 0.12$ ms (range 0.48--0.92 ms)
\citep[mice:][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

*** ANF to Tuberculoventral cells

 #+latex: \textsc{Synapse type}: As in \VCN stellate cells, \ANF terminals form
glutamate \AMPA receptors in the deep \DCN neurons, \TV cells.  \EPSPs from AN
shocks can be blocked with an \AMPA antagonist \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b},
confirming the \ANFTV synapse is glutamatergic and of type \AMPA\@.  The dynamics
of the \AMPA synapse is single-exponential with decay time constant 0.4 ms
\citep{GardnerTrussellEtAl:1999}, significantly slower for \TV cells compared to
stellate and octopus cells (mean decay time constant 0.36 ms).

\citet{Liberman:1993} provided meticulous detail of the projection of the
different \SR ANFs into the DCN\@. \LSR fibres have more collaterals and more
terminals endings in the \DCN than \HSR\space \ANFs \citep{Liberman:1993}. \HSR
fibres in the low frequency region (\CF $<$ 5 kHz) contact more somata than \LSR
fibres \citep{Liberman:1993}, 5 and 1 respectively.

Somatic contacts are more significant per fibre in the low frequency region and
are provided by \HSR fibres that showed Somatic contacts in DCN appear to be
more common for low-CF fibres than for high-CF fibres (Fig. 5B). For CFs below
5.0 kHz, DCN regions also show significantly more contacts per high-SR fibre
than per low-SR fibre.
The primary excitatory input to TV cells is likely to come from medium to low
spontaneous rate \ANFs and TS cells
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999,ZhangOertel:1993b} (with the exception of
TS cells in rats), and filtered through its dendrites.

 #+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts}: The average number and strength of \ANF
synaptic terminals on TV cells is not well known. In all mammals, \ANF synaptic
terminals on TS cells are primarily dendritic (mice: \citealt{ZhangOertel:1993b},
guinea pig: $<$ 4 somatic contacts per cell \citealt{Alibardi:1999}, cats: few
somatic contacts \citealt{Liberman:1993,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}, rat:
\citealt{RubioJuiz:2004}).

 #+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: \TV cell dendrites are aligned with the 
incoming \ANF axons, hence their other name /vertical/ cells
\citep{Rhode:1999}. The dendritic width perpendicular to the \ANF axons
(approximately 70 \um \citealt{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,ZhangOertel:1993b}) is
identical to the average axon termination width of \ANFs
\citep{Rhode:1999,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Delay}: The latency of \EPSPs to AN shock (1.0--1.5 ms) is
longer than the stellate neurons of the \VCN\space \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.
The difference is also matched in the first spike latency to acoustic input
(\FSL 4.0-4.4 ms, \citealt{Rhode:1999,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}).

*** ANF to Golgi cells

 #+latex: \textsc{Synapse type}: The synaptic type of afferent inputs to Golgi
cells in dependent on the type of \ANF\@. Type I \ANF bouton terminals form an
\AMPA synapse, while type II\space \ANF terminations form diffuse synapses that are
mixed \AMPA/\NMDA receptors
\citep{Cant:1992,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,RyugoWrightEtAl:1993,Ryugo:1992,RyugoParks:2003,HurdHutsonEtAl:1999}.
The dynamics of the \AMPA receptor synapse in Golgi cells has not been recorded
and the resulting post-synaptic response of \ANF inputs at the soma would be
heavily filtered by their thin dendrites.

 #+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts}: Golgi cells have little to no excitatory
synaptic contacts on their cell body \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  The
primary afferent input terminates on the thin dendrites (0.5--1 \um width) of the
Golgi cells \citep{BensonBrown:2004,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: Type I \ANFs projecting to the \GCD and
outer shell of the \VCN were generally \LSR units.  The average width of the
axonal terminals perpendicular to the isofrequency laminae
is 175 \um but in the low frequency areas the termination field is significantly
broadened (1 mm) \citep{Ryugo:2008}.  Type II \ANF axonal terminations are less
organised in \GCD\space \citep{WeedmanPongstapornEtAl:1996,RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993}.  The
dendritic field of the Golgi cells emanates uniformly from the cell body by
100--250 \um \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The wide dynamic range observed
in extracellular recordings in the marginal shell area (equivalent to the \GCD
in rodents) suggests Golgi cells receive \ANF inputs from a range of
isofrequencies \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Delay}: Delay times for monosynaptic \EPSPs to be recorded in
Golgi cells in response to AN shocks are $1.27 \pm 0.05$ ms
\citep[n=4,][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The mean minimal latency between
Golgi cells and T stellate cells in the \VCN magnocellular core was \sim 0.57
ms, but on average \EPSPs were 0.7 ms longer in Golgi cells.  The theoretical
conductance delay of unmyelinated type II\space \ANFs from the cochlea to the position
of Golgi cells in the \GCD, was estimated to be 10 ms \citep{Brown:1993}.


** Glycinergic inputs

*** D stellate cell input to Tuberculoventral cells

 #+latex: \textsc{Synapse type}: DS cells are immuno-reactive to glycine and can
be retrogradely labeled from the DCN
\citep{DoucetRossEtAl:1999,DoucetRyugo:1997,FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003,DoucetRyugo:2006,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.
Bouton terminals with flat vesicles on the TV cell's soma and dendrites are
typical of the GlyR synapse \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}. Intracellular recordings in
TV cells have also shown high sensitivity to GlyR-blocker strychnine
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,ZhangOertel:1993b}.  The dynamics of the GlyR receptor
include a fast rise time of 0.4 ms and decay time constant 2.3 ms
\citep{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,LimOleskevichEtAl:2003}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts}: Detailed analysis of TV cells' synaptic
contacts has been performed on the rat \citep{RubioJuiz:2004} and the guinea pig
\citep{Alibardi:1999} and the cat
\citep{OsenOttersenEtAl:1990,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.  The few somatic contacts
on the soma of TV cells were glycinergic
\citenum{Alibardi:1999,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999,ZhangOertel:1993b}, but most GlyR
synapses were on the proximal dendrites \citep{RubioJuiz:2004,Alibardi:1999}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: The dendrites of \TV cells remain within
their isofrequency lamina. The axon collaterals of DS cells in the DCN are
diffuse are can cover almost half the nuclei \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.
Lateral inhibitory sidebands in the \EIRA of labelled TS cells are equivalent to
the wide-bandwidth of DS cells
\citenum{OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  The DS cell projection
generally a tonotopic arrangement (guinea pig:
\citealt{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}); however, detailed analysis show more terminals
and collaterals ventral to the iso-frequency band of the DS cell (i.e., stronger
high \CF to low \CF) \citep{DoucetRyugoEtAl:1999,FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}.
Notch noise response in type II\space DCN units possibly shows a offset in
wide-band inhibitory projections around 0.2 octaves from high \CF to low
\CF\space \citep{ReissYoung:2005}.

#+latex: \textsc{Delay}: The minimum \EPSP latency to VCN shock, presumably
from \TS cells in /in vitro/ preparations in mice was 2 ms
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.  Assuming similar axonal distances by DS and TS cells
to reach the deep layers of the DCN from similar locations in the AVCN or PVCN,
the delay of \DS cell input to TV cells is 2 ms.  The delay from AN shock to
\IPSPs in TV cells is 2.5 ms in mice \citep{WickesbergOertel:1993}.

*** D stellate cells input to T stellate cells

 #+latex: \textsc{Synapse type}:  The fast GlyR glycinergic receptors are
the synaptic type of DS cell terminals on TS cells (mice
\citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}).  DS cells have been directly traced back
to to cell body from glycinergic terminals (flat vesicles) apposed to TS units
in the cat \citep{SmithRhode:1989}.  Could be mixed Gly/\GABA terminals
\citep{AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993}, likely from periolivary terminals.  The
dynamics of the \DS to TS cell synapse is the same as above for DS connection of
\TV cells (0.4 ms rise time, single decay time constant 2.3 ms,
\citealt{AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,LimOleskevichEtAl:2003}).

 #+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts}: TS cells receive a large number of glycinergic
contacts on their cell body and dendrites (mice:
\citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}, cat
\citealt{SmithRhode:1989}). Glycinergic terminals could be from DS or TV cells.
In the chinchilla, TS cells in the high \CF region have been shown to have more
glycinergic somatic terminals than low \CF region (\sim 20 high \CF, \sim 10 low
\CF, \citealt{JosephsonMorest:1998}).  In the cat, TS cells receive 1 or 2
glycinergic contacts on their cell body and many more on their dendrites
\citep{SmithRhode:1989}.  Flat vesicle boutons (shared with TV inputs) account
for 17\% of terminals on the soma (21\% \TAC), 23\% of proximal terminals (46\%
\TAC), and 27\% of distal terminals (22\% \TAC) \citep{SmithRhode:1989}.


 #+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: Axon collaterals of the DS cell cover
on average 300 \um of \VCN (mice: \citealt{OertelWuEtAl:1990}, gerbil:
\citealt{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}), which is approximately half the possible
range.  The effective receptive field of DS cells onto TS cells is approximately
3 octaves centred on-\CF (or centred on the isofrequency lamina of the
projecting DS cells' cell body).  The input receptive field of the receiving TS
cells (i.e., the dendritic field span) is contained with one isofrequency lamina
\citep[mice:]{OertelWuEtAl:1990}.  Lateral inhibitory sidebands in chopper
cells, highly variable between chopper subtypes, correlate with the suggested
wide-band inhibition centred on-\CF by DS cells (suppression bandwidth $5.1 \pm
4.5$ kHz for all choppers, \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}).  Ionotopopheretic
studies also show suppression of glycine synapses with strychnine modulates
firing rate responses on-\CF
\citep{CasparyHaveyEtAl:1979,ZhaoEvans:1990,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994} and alters
temporal behaviour in TS cells \citep{CasparyPalombiEtAl:1993}

# \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994a}

 #+latex: \textsc{Delay}: The minimal synaptic delay between two adjacent cells
is estimated to be 0.4 ms.  Shocks to the auditory nerve produce disynaptic
\IPSPs from 1.2 to 3.5 msec
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,NeedhamPaolini:2003,Oertel:1983}.  The
variability in delay between DS and TS cells may be due to the convalescent
routes taken by the DS cell axons.  Some axons have been seen to travel to the
\DCN before returning the \VCN
\citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,DoucetRyugo:2006,DoucetRyugo:1997} and commissural
inputs (DS units in the contralateral CN) take 1.52 ms to reach TS cells after a
shock to the contralateral \CN\space \citep{NeedhamPaolini:2006}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: Dendrites of TS cells remain within their 
isofrequency lamina.  \TV terminals projecting to the VCN are generally
tonotopic.  The distribution is concentrated on \CF in mice
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}, but slightly lateral and lighter on-CF in cats
\citep{OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.  Glycinergic terminals are also more dense in
high CF regions in the \VCN of chinchilla \citep{JosephsonMorest:1998}.

 #+latex: \textsc{Delay}: The effective delay from AN shock to \DCN~\TV
cell excitation to \IPSPs in \TS cells is approximately 2 ms in mice
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}.  This study isolated \AVCN\space \TS cells by
slicing the AN fibres passing through the \PVCN, then exciting the TV cells by
shocks to the severed fibres entering the \DCN\@.

# nerve, which innervates tuberculoventral cells, inhibitory
# postsynaptic potentials recorded intracellularly from AVCN
# neurons had a latency of about 2 ms \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}.
In chinchilla, \IPSPs were recorded 0.60 ms after \EPSPs in TS cells after AN
clicks \citep{Wickesberg:1996}.  Since inputs to the VCN from the DCN are
inhibitory, delayed and topographic, they can suppress the delayed, on-
frequency signals created by echoes. On the basis of the latency ﬁndings,
therefore, \citet{WickesbergOertel:1990} proposed that the projection from the
deep DCN contributes to monaural echo suppression.

# WickesbergOertel:1990
# The timing of the inhibition through the DCN is shown in
# Figure 4. The descending branch of the auditory nerve was
# separated
# from the ascending
# branch by a cut through the PVCN\@.
# While recording in AVCN, stimulating electrodes on the PVCN
# could activate connections through the DCN, but not circuits
# intrinsic to the AVCN\@.
# The top trace shows an IPSP recorded
# in a bushy cell in AVCN in response to a shock to the PVCN\@.
# The IPSP began about 2 msec after the PVCN stimulation.
# Stimulation of the auditory nerve root produced an EPSP with
# a latency of 0.7 msec (bottom trace). The bottom trace has been
# shifted so that the stimulus artifacts are 2 msec apart. The peak
# of the suprathreshold EPSP then occurs at the same time as the
# trough of the IPSP\@. A simple interpretation of this experiment
# is that action potentials in auditory nerve fibres evoke IPSPs
# that can suppress later inputs from auditory nerve fibres.
# Suppression is maximal when the interval between signals in
# auditory nerve fibres is 2 msec; at smaller intervals the suppres-
# sion has not developed and at larger intervals the suppression
# is less than maximal.



** GABAergic inputs

*** Golgi cell input to D stellate cells

#+latex: \textsc{Synapse type}: \GABAa receptor has been identified in DS cell
GABAergic synapses
\citep{EvansZhao:1998,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,Mugnaini:1985,MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,SaintMorestEtAl:1989}
In isolated \VCN mice slices, application of
\GABAa blocker bicuculine showed significant increase in \DS cell excitation
following shocks to the \AN\space \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

#+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts}: \GABAa-ergic synapses from \GLG cells on DS

The large and early effect of \GABAa blocker bicuculine /in vitro/ suggests \GLG
cells' synapses are strong on \DS cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
Microscopic studies in the cat show pleomorphic vesicles competing with other
synapses on the densely packed surface of the cell ($\sim$20 weak inputs
\citealt{SaintMorestEtAl:1989}, Soma: 36\% of terminals, 87\% TAC,  Prox: 18\% of
terminals, 81\% TAC,  Dist: 41\% of terminals, 22\% TAC
\citealt{SmithRhode:1989}))

#+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: Dendrites of DS cells emanate 250--350 \um
in all directions including penetration of the \VCN to of the overlying \GCD
\citep{DoucetRyugo:1997,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.  \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997} noted
that DS cell dendrites penetrated the nearest of the surrounding \GCD
independent of the cells position in the magnocellular core of the \VCN\@.  The
Golgi axonal plexus surrounds the cell body and does not travel further than 250
\um \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Pharmacological ionotopopheretic
application of bicuculine increases the activity of \PVCN\space \DS cells only
within its receptive field \citep{PalombiCaspary:1992}.

#+latex: \textsc{Delay}: Hyperpolarisation occurs 10--15 ms after
click (mice: \citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}, rat:
\citealt{PaoliniClark:1999}). The delay of ANF inputs to Golgi cells ranges from
2.4 to over 10 ms \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}. Golgi cell axons remain
within the \GCD, hence the time to \IPSP action in the soma of DS cells will be
determined by synaptic diffusion and dendritic filtering.

*** Golgi cell input to T stellate cells

#+latex: \textsc{Synaptic Contacts}: The number of \GABAa-ergic synapses from
\GLG cells on TS cells is not fully known. Five to 15 pleomorphic terminals
contacted the soma and dendrites of TS cells in cats \citep{SmithRhode:1989}.
Nearly half of the few synapses on the soma were pleomorphic and up to one third

34\% of terminals, 46\% TAC;  Dist: 33\% of terminals, 22\% TAC
\citealt{SmithRhode:1989}). IPSPs were not observed in bicuculine-sensitive \TS
cells /in vitro/ slices suggesting dendritic filtering from distal synapses
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

#+latex: \textsc{Receptive Fields}: Dendrites of TS cells remain with their iso
frequency lamina and penetrate the overlying \GCD
\citep{DoucetRyugo:1997,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The

application of bicuculine increases the activity of \PVCN\space \TS cells only
within its receptive field \citep{PalombiCaspary:1992}.  An electron microscopic
study in the chinchilla suggests a significant difference in \GABA synapses on
the soma of \TS cells: higher \CF had \sim 20 synapses, while lower frequency
\CF \TS cells had \sim 10 \GABA synapses \citep{JosephsonMorest:1998}.


 #+latex: \textsc{Delay}: Similarly to DS cells, the time to \IPSP action in the

# Proposed neuronal connections
# The present considerations have provided evidence for the
# connections that are summarised in Fig. 15. We propose that
# T stellate cells receive excitatory, glutamatergic input from
# a small number of type I auditory nerve fibres (monosynaptic
# \EPSPs) as well as through collaterals of other T stellate
# cells (late \EPSPs) (Oertel et al. 1990). The topographic
# arrangement of tuberculoventral cells indicates that roughly
# the same group of auditory nerve fibres innervates tuberculo-
# ventral cells which, in turn, provide delayed, glycinergic
# inhibition (Wickesberg and Oertel 1988, 1990). D stellate
# cells contribute to the disynaptic \IPSP and at high shock
# strengths can provide trains of late \IPSPs to T stellate cells.
# D Stellate cells are driven by type I auditory nerve fibres
# (Oertel et al. 1990; this study), and they receive GABAergic
# inhibition, of which Golgi cells are a likely source (Mugnaini
# 1985). Golgi cells lie in the granule cell domain, away from
# the terminals of type I auditory nerve fibres. The finding
# that they are activated by shocks to the auditory nerve more
# slowly than that to T or D stellate cells in the vicinity sug-
# gests that they are activated by type II auditory nerve fibres
# (Benson et al. 1996; Ferragamo et al. 1997).










* Computational Models of the Cochlear Nucleus

\todo[inline]{Needs more work on introduction of this section, vast amount of
previous work, their faults, HOW my work fits in}



** Single neuron models of the chopper unit 

A number of stellate models have been developed previously.  The basic
approaches include point neuron models
\citep{HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,ErikssonRobert:1999,PressnitzerMeddisEtAl:2001} and
conductance based compartmental models
\citep{BanksSachs:1991,WhiteYoungEtAl:1994,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,WangSachs:1995}. Recently,
a single compartment model with accurate membrane conductances was developed
based on whole cell recordings in \VCN neurons \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The
mechanisms that contribute to the electrical activity of stellate cells are the
voltage-gated ionic currents that give the cell its chopping behaviour.
\citet{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b} presented three
new potassium current models from whole cell recordings in the \VCN\@.  The
significance of each membrane current in the spiking behaviour of bushy and
stellate cells is explored in their single-compartment modelling study
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The cell models I have designed incorporate Rothman
and Manis’ membrane currents into a multi-compartmental model similar to
\citet{BanksSachs:1991} stellate model.

These models have been used to explore some basic responses of stellate cells
seen physiologically:
  - Regularity and chopping behaviour
    \citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994,ArleKim:1991,HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,BanksSachs:1991}
  - Synchronisation to envelope
    \citep{HewittMeddisEtAl:1992,GhoshalKimEtAl:1992,WangSachs:1995}
  - Enhancement of dynamic range relative to \ANFs
    \citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,ErikssonRobert:1999}
  - Effects of lateral inhibition
    \citep{Shamma:1985,ErikssonRobert:1999,PressnitzerMeddisEtAl:2001}


*** Rothman and Manis Current Models in VCN Bushy and Stellate Cells

Present a robust model of VCN neurons based on previous experimental studies.
  - Replicates current clamp responses: type I of stellate cells and type II of
    bushy cells
  - Replicates simple PSTH responses solely based on sub- or supra-threshold
    excitation at the soma
  - Replicates Phase locking capabilities of neurons (simulated steady state
    input)
  - Derived from a complete characterisation of K+ currents rather than ad hoc
    assumptions: hence more accurate.  The greatest difference between the
    previous models is voltage dependent IHT and ILT currents.
  - IA has a role in modulating the rate of repetitive firing.  Increasing gA
    counteracted depolarising effects of EPSPs, thereby increasing threshold for
    AP\@.  Effects of inhibition on T stellate cells could be to reset IA
  - ILT plays a role in type II by reducing input R hence reducing the membrane
    time constant.  In intermediate type I-i cells small amount of ILT had a
    greater affect on rate of firing than IA\@. Small ILT could also benefit
    neurons by reducing EPSPs near the axon hillock and reducing AP back
    propagation in proximal dendrites.
  - Modulation of IKLT: Coincidence detection neurons would benefit from ILT
    up-regulation to reduce membrane time constant, reduce EPSP height and
    width.  Enhanced temporal acuity at onset, reduced firing during sustained
    period, reduced spontaneous activity, reduction in refractory period that
    leads to faster firing rates.  Increasing ILT drops Vrest, hence Ih must be
    used to counterbalance ILT\@.



** Microcircuit Models in the Cochlear Nucleus

The first network models in the cochlear nucleus revolved around the \DCN
\citep{DavisVoigt:1991,ArleKim:1990,ArleKim:1991a,Arle:1992}.  The
cerebellar-like circuitry of the \DCN and their complex \EIRA cell type
behaviours were modelled by Blum and colleagues
\citep{BlumReed:2000,BlumReed:1998,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1995}
and then in greater detail by Davis and colleagues
\citep{DavisVoigt:1996,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:2001}.
The role of DS cell inhibition in the \DCN circuitry has been explored even
further, with suggestions of asymmetrical wide-band inhibition onto \EIRA type
II units (TV cells) \citep{ReissYoung:2005,LomakinDavis:2008,YoungDavis:2002}


Selective processing of different \ANF inputs using some form of inhibition was
the first step toward including interneurons in a T stellate cell model
\citep{LaiWinslowEtAl:1994,LaiWinslowEtAl:1994a}.  Lateral inhibition was
studied in an abstract model of auditory processing by \citet{Shamma:1985}.  The
only model to consider a network with TV and DS cells in a \VCN chopper model
was \citet{ErikssonRobert:1999}.  Both of these studies did not utilise the
important dendritic and membrane cell properties of T stellate cells and did not
include recurrent T stellate connections or GABAergic inhibition.


Recurrent excitation between TS cells is thought to be present in mice
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} and has been investigated in two modelling
studies \citep{BahmerLangner:2006,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}, but neither study
represents a realistic implementation of the stellate microcircuit.
\citet{BahmerLangner:2006} used excitatory onset units to regulate the recurrent
T stellate cells, unfortunately the only excitatory onset units in the cochlear
nucleus are octopus cells, which do not have axonal collaterals in the \VCN\@.
Recurrent networks in the cortex prefer inhibition for synchronisation
\citep{LyttonSejnowski:1991,BushSejnowski:1996}.

Table \ref{tab:ModellingCNTable} gives a summary of all neural models and
networks of the cochlear nucleus.

The current state of neural network models fail to deliver at producing a
biophysically-realistic model of the cochlear nucleus, specifically the
microcircuit regulating the main output neurons \TS cells.

 - lack of recent current models Rothman and Manis current models
 - lack of GABAergic neurons
 - incorrect use of known microcircuit surrounding T stellate cells

   microcircuit.
 - explore streamlined optimisation of all parameters in simplified CNSM using
   genetic algorithms
 - explore detailed, sequential optimisation of cochlear nucleus T-stellate
   microcircuit's parameters through simple responses
 - verification of optimised cochlear nucleus T-stellate microcircuit with \AM
   coding and vowel processing, with explicit analysis of TS cells/choppers


**  Define the hypotheses (from Confirmation Report)

# from confirmation report

*** Hypothesis 1
Enhancement of the rate-place representation of spectral shape in \ChS and \ChT
units, relative to \ANFs, is owing to lateral inhibitory mechanisms chopper
units maintain a robust representation of stimulus spectrum despite a reduction
in spectral shape from auditory nerve inputs \citep{PalmerShamma:2003}. Lateral
inhibition from interneurons in the cochlear nucleus mediates the spectral
enhancement seen in the rate-place representation of transiently chopping T
stellate cells. This mechanism implies that the rate-place representation of
complex stimuli will be significantly reduced if any sources of inhibition are
removed.

*** Hypothesis 2
Enhancement of the rate-place representation of spectral shape in \ChS and \ChT
units, relative to \ANFs, is due in part to recurrent excitation by among T
stellate cells within the same frequency band. Intracellular and morphological
evidence suggests recurrent excitation among T stellate cells is likely to occur
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  Recurrent excitation
introduces considerable non-linearity to the network as regions of high energy
will elicit self-excitation.  This mechanism could explain the steady response
of \ChT cells despite a reduction in sustained firing rate of \ANFs due to
transient adaptation.

*** Hypothesis 3
Enhancement of the temporal representation of the fundamental frequency of
vowels in chopper units, relative to \ANFs, is due to network mechanisms in the
stellate microcircuit.  Synchronisation to regular envelope fluctuations in T
stellate cells, particularly \ChT units, is enhanced relative to \ANFs
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  Enhanced synchronisation to
the fundamental frequency of vowels in T stellate cells could be used to
segregate concurrent signals \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.  Tonic inhibition
from GABAergic sources and precise onset inhibition from glycinergic sources are
critical mechanisms that allow T stellate cells to accurately respond to
pulsatile stimuli, such as the f0 of vowels.

\todo[inline]{Note: Hypothesis 4 in the confirmation regarding psychophysical
limitations and forward masking has been removed}


# *** Hypothesis 4
# Lateral inhibition in the T stellate network is responsible for setting the
# upper limits of psychophysical simultaneous and forward masking T stellate cells
# convey important spectral information to higher auditory centres and are the
# first to process across-spectral information in the auditory pathway. Forward
# masking in T stellate cells has been shown to be comparable to the limits of
# psycho-physical perception \citep{BoettcherSalviEtAl:1990,Shore:1995} and is
# heavily influenced by inhibition \citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997,Shore:1998}.
# Lateral suppression reduces the firing rate of T stellate cells
# \citep{BlackburnSachs:1992,RhodeGreenberg:1994a} indicating a spread of masking
# to high and low frequency areas similar to the spreading function and offset of
# \citet{Johnston:1988}.  I concede that there are significant masking effects
# performed by other nuclei in the auditory pathway but these only add to the
# masking performed in the cochlear nucleus. This hypothesis suggests the upper
# limits of auditory detection for across-spectral and temporal masking is due
# primarily to lateral inhibition in the stellate network.
