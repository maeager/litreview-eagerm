Recent Reviews of characterised cells and projections
\citep{CantBenson:2003,RyugoParks:2003,SmithMassieEtAl:2005,YoungOertel:2004,OertelWrightEtAl:2010}

% Except for a few differences to be mentioned later, cell types in
% rat and cat appear to be quite similar and are also identifiable
% in a number of other species, including human [6,87,136]
% and other primates [87,141]; chinchilla [138,165]; gerbil
% [145,165]; guinea pig [75,76,133]; kangaroo rat [45,251];
% mole [114]; mouse [239,252,262,264]; porpoise [162];
% rabbit [53,172] and several species of bats [59,208,269].

% Smith and Rhode [220] were able to divide the large mul-
% tipolar neurons in the posterior part of the AVCN and the
% anterior part of the PVCN of the cat into two groups based
% on differences in physiological response properties, synaptic
% organization, the pathway taken by the axons, and the types
% of vesicles contained in their synaptic terminals. Their com-
% prehensive study has provided a framework for a synthesis
% of results from a number of laboratories, all of which are
% compatible with the conclusion that the ventral cochlear nu-
% cleus contains at least two functionally distinct populations
% of multipolar cells.

studies that have performed physiological unit assessments as well as
classification of morphology via labelling.

% auditory brain stem. Most of the different neuron popula-
% tions in the magnocellular core are contacted by individual
% auditory nerve fibres. These cells, along with the incoming
% auditory nerve fibres, are arranged in isofrequency contours
% and have identical CFs. They can, however, exhibit different
% thresholds and temporal patterns in their spike discharges.
% That is, when presented with short tone bursts at CF, the
% PSTH can display reliable but distinctly different patterns
% [16,18,147,156]. These PSTHs are named by their shapes,
% such as primary-like, chopper, onset, pauser, or build-up.
% Intracellular recording and staining methods have demon-
% strated that neurons with different firing patterns generally
% manifest different morphological features, including but not
% limited to, dendritic appearance, cell body size and shape,
% and axonal projections (e.g. [53,157,158,164]). Some of
% these differences are attributed, at least in part, to the nature
% of the neuron’s input from the auditory nerve [86,117], but
% intrinsic membrane properties assume equal prominence
% [5,61,107,108,129].


% 6.3. Receptors and transmitters
% The auditory system has demanding functions with re-
% spect to processing sound for localization, identification,
% and communication. Key to these functions is the ability to
% receive and transmit faithfully rapid changes in the acoustic
% signal. The large endbulbs of Held reﬂect one specialization
% for secure transmission [130,146,168] and the amino acid
% glutamate is the most likely candidate that facilitates rapid
% transmission [57,119,150]. One difficulty in the identifica-
% tion of glutamate as the auditory nerve neurotransmitter is its
% ubiquitous distribution in tissue and the inability to measure
% its release during synaptic activity. Consequently, research
% efforts have been directed towards the study of pharmaco-
% logic agonists and antagonists of glutamate, the analysis of
% glutamate receptor subunits, and/or the role of glutamate
% transporters. As in birds, the bulk of available evidence im-
% plicates glutamate as the neurotransmitter for the auditory
% nerve. Quantitative immunogold staining methods revealed
% significantly greater labelling over primary endings com-
% pared to nonprimary endings (containing ﬂat or pleomorphic
% vesicles) and glia [64]. Furthermore, immunogold staining
% was significantly lower in primary terminals that had been
% depleted of glutamate by potassium-induced depolarization.
% The production and/or utilization of glutamate is mediated
% by aspartate aminotransferase. The soluble cytoplasmic
% fraction of this amino acid has been immunolocalized to
% endings of auditory nerve fibres [2,166]. The presence of
% glutamate and one of its metabolic precursors in the presy-
% naptic endings is complemented by glutamate receptors
% in cochlear nucleus neurons (e.g. [143,144,167,213,217]).
% These receptors include ionotropic receptors that are formed
% by several subunits surrounding a central ion channel, and
% metabotropic receptors that associate with G-proteins and
% tend to mediate long-term responses.
% The ionotropic receptors include AMPA, kainate, delta,
% and NMDA types. AMPA receptors mediate the fast exci-
% tatory transmission and consist of four subunits, GluR1–4
% with ﬂip, ﬂop, and other splice variants. Primary endings
% in the cochlear nucleus oppose AMPA receptors composed
% mainly of GluR3 and GluR4 [143,167,213]. The GluR4 sub-
% units gate rapidly and are specialized for auditory nerve in-
% put [119]. The GluR2 subunits, which exhibit slower AMPA
% kinetics, are associated with parallel fibre inputs in the DCN
% [56]. Primary endings are also associated with delta recep-
% tors but it is not known if delta receptors form functional
% receptors.

% NMDA receptors are characterized by a voltage-dependent
% calcium channel. It is thought that depolarization via the
% AMPA receptors is required for the NMDA receptor to
% open. The calcium-permeability of NMDA is presumed to
% form the basis of the long-term effects underlying learn-
% ing and memory. There are a number of NMDA receptors,
% including NR1 (with eight splice variants), NR2A-D, and
% NR3. Receptors are composed of NR1 plus one or more
% variants of NR2 which determine their physiological prop-
% erties. NR1 has a widespread distribution in the cochlear
% nucleus [15,143]. NR2A and NR2C are found in the su-
% perficial granule cell layer of the ventral cochlear nucleus
% and in medium sized neurons of the deeper layers of the
% DCN. NR2A is in the large neurons of the rostral AVCN
% and NR2B is in pyramidal cells of the DCN. There is
% pharmacologic evidence that reveals an early presence of
% NMDA receptors in the developing auditory system that di-
% minishes shortly after weaning [54,73]. Such data indicate
% that NMDA receptors may play a role in the development
% of the non-NMDA receptors.

% Metabotropic glutamate receptors are thought of as sin-
% gle molecules coupled to G-proteins. The G-proteins are
% linked to intracellular transduction pathways that may un-
% derlie plasticity. There are three types of metabotropic re-
% ceptors based on their pharmacologic properties and second
% messenger cascades [126]. In the cochlear nucleus, immuno-
% cytochemical staining demonstrates labeling of mGluR1␣
% and mGluR5 [143], which are involved in the initiation
% of the phosphoinositol transduction pathway [127]. These
% metabotropic receptors are distributed in the perisynaptic
% membrane that ﬂanks the postsynaptic membrane density
% [128,145].

% Transmitter released from auditory nerve endings must be
% rapidly removed from the synaptic cleft so that the postsy-
% naptic cell is prepared for the next transmission. The removal
% and inactivation of neurotransmitter is accomplished by a
% highly efficient system of uptake and transporter molecules
% that surround glutamatergic synapses [9,10,46]. It has been
% speculated that glial processes and neuronal membranes lin-
% ing the intercellular cisternae between primary endings and
% cochlear nucleus neurons might house the relevant trans-
% porter molecules [154]. Regulation of residual transmitter
% by glial transporters has been suggested as a means to con-
% trol synaptic strength [210]. A preference for transporter
% molecules to be distributed along the membranes lining these
% perisynaptic cisternae could provide important insights into
% synaptic function.
